<h3 id="About">About WebDAV</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV (WWW Distributed Authoring and
Versioning)</a> is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol, which allows users
to collaboratively edit and manage web resources on remote servers. It aims to
extend the HTTP protocol to develop new distributed authoring tools in the web,
specially emphasizing the collaborative authoring of web pages.</p>

<p>The <em>lock mechanism</em> defined in WebDAV has been design to prevent the
resources overwriting (that is, to prevent the lost update problem) using the
operations lock and unlock. </p>

<p>A lock controls the write access to a resource by limiting HTTP writing
operations, like PUT, POST and DELETE. This means that only somebody who knows
the lock will be able to execute those operations. </p>

<p>The WebDAV protocol also defines two <strong>lock scopes</strong>: <em>an
</em><em>exclusive and a shared lock</em>. </p>
<ul>
  <li>An exclusive lock guarantees that one person possess the lock, and no one
    else will be able to lock the resource (it does not affect the resource
    reading). </li>
  <li>A shared lock allows a group of users to create their locks over a
    resource, but they must trust each other to prevent access problems.
    Besides, each lock has a timeout, but the user cannot forget that locks may
    disappear in the server due to exceptions in the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more informations about WebDAV in <a
href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a> and also at
the <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV.org</a> website.</p>

<h3 id="WebDAV">WebDAV support in Amaya</h3>

<p>Amaya has a limited support for WebDAV. This includes the following
operations: lock/unlock a WebDAV resource, a toggle that shows when there is a
lock, and a function to get the current lock information. </p>

<p>Besides, it also includes some awareness functions, that can automatically
inform users about locked resources.</p>

<h3 id="Sharing">Sharing documents</h3>

<p>The WebDAV support in Amaya intents to help small groups of users to edit
collaboratively their web pages. </p>

<p>To illustrate how it works, suppose that you have a WebDAV server (indeed,
you <strong>must</strong> have a Web server that supports WebDAV to work with
it) named <code>davserver.mycompany.com</code>, and you and your colleagues
want to edit collaboratively some documents that are in the WebDAV folder
<code>/shared/</code> (WebDAV folders are called collections).</p>

<p>So, imagine that you need to change the document
<code>http://davserver.mycompany.com/shared/Doc1.html</code>. </p>
<ul>
  <li>You load the document in your Amaya editor, and then you can
    <em>lock</em> this document (<strong>Lock resource</strong> entry in
    <strong>Tools/Cooperation</strong> menu. </li>
  <li>Once you locked the document, if one of your colleagues tries to save
    some change in this document, s/he will be warned about your lock, and
    updates will not be lost automatically. </li>
  <li>Thus, while the document is locked, you can safely modify it, and when
    you have finished your work and saved the document, you can <em>unlock</em>
    it, allowing you colleague to lock the document and do his/her
    modifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>When loading a page from a WebDAV server, Amaya automatically informs about
the lock/unlock status of the page.</p>

<h3 id="WebDAV1">WebDAV options</h3>

<p>The following options can be set with the <strong>Preferences /
WebDAV</strong> dialog box.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>User's personal reference (URL)</dt>
    <dd>An URL that identifies the user. Example:
      <code>mailto:myself@myhost.com</code> or
      <code>http://myhost.com/myhomepage.html</code> </dd>
  <dt>Lock Depth</dt>
    <dd>If depth is infinite, a lock over a collection (folder) will affect all
      components. Otherwise, the lock will affect only the collection,
      preventing an user that does not know the lock to create or remove
      components. </dd>
  <dt>Lock Scope</dt>
    <dd>The lock scope: exclusive or shared. </dd>
  <dt>Lock Timeout</dt>
    <dd>The desired timeout for the lock. "Infinite" means that there is no
      timeout value, and "Other (Seconds)" will try to get a timeout value of
      <em>x</em> seconds (value <em>x</em> specified by the next field).<br />
    </dd>
  <dt>User's WebDAV Resource List (URL URL)</dt>
    <dd>A list of the URLs of the resources you use as WebDAV resources. </dd>
