# Guide to Optimized Publication Standards

## Overview

This page provides information about standards for creating Optimized EPUB Publications, which are publications that have been specially designed to address the needs of a specific reading modality.

This document should not be read as a formal registry, as the EPUB 3 Working Group does not control how conformance to any standard is expressed.

Refer to the [EPUB Accessibility specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/) for more information about these kinds of publications, and how to include the standard identifiers in the Package Document metadata.

To request the addition of a standard to this list, please open a new issue in the tracker.

## Standards

Inclusion of standards in this guide does not constitute endorsement of them by the EPUB 3 Working Group or the W3C and its board or membership.
