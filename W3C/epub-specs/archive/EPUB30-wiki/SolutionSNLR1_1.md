# SNL\_R1.1\_PS1 Media Queries #

Media Queries are used by both HTML5 and CSS3 to determine characteristics of a particular user agent, device and viewport. These queries extend the previous limited list of media previously used by @media, @import and the link element. See http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/ for details. Media queries can be used both in the link element of HTML5 and in CSS3 (@media and @import). If we adopt one location, it seems like we should adopt them all.

This solution can address (to varying degrees) use cases 1 to 4. It does not address the specific example in case 5, "`[...]`  displays with poor refresh rates may want to use a static image in place of a video." There is no capability to detect refresh rates in the current media query spec.

Drafting note: The plan for this, as the target W3C specification is currently at the Candidate Recommendation stage is to normatively reference a non-dated version of the CSS3 Media Queries, preceded by a normative note that display characteristics generated by use of these properties can not be guaranteed.

Pros:
  1. Standards based (being adopted by CSS3 and HTML5), in a fairly stable draft (Candidate Rec)
  1. Wide implementation support in existing user agents
  1. Conforming 2.0 Reading Systems should ignore styles using these queries, but should still process the remainder of the styles

Cons:
  1. Not a final spec
  1. May not support all device information we care about
