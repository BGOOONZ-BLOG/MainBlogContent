<p><strong>Transient activation</strong> (or “transient user activation”) is a window state that indicates a user has recently pressed a button, moved a mouse, used a menu, or performed some other user interaction.</p>
<p>This state is sometimes used as a mechanism for ensuring that a web API can only function if triggered by user interaction. For example, scripts cannot arbitrarily launch a popup that requires <em>transient activation</em> ⁠—it must be triggered from a UI element’s event handler.</p>
<p>Examples of APIs that require <em>transient activation</em> are: - {{domxref(“MediaDevices.selectAudioOutput()”)}}</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Transient activation expires after a timeout (if not renewed by further interaction), and may also be “consumed” by some APIs.</p>
