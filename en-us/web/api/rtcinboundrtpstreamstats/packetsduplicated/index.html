<p>The <strong><code>packetsDuplicated</code></strong> property of the {{domxref(“RTCInboundRtpStreamStats”)}} dictionary indicates the total number of packets discarded because they were duplicates of previously-received packets.</p>
<p>These packets are not counted by the {{domxref(“RTCInboundRtpSreamStats.packetsDiscarded”, “packetsDiscarded”)}} property.</p>

<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>An integer value which specifies how many duplcate packets have been received by the local end of this RTP stream so far. These duplicate packets are not included in the {{domxref(“RTCInboundRtpSreamStats.packetsDiscarded”, “packetsDiscarded”)}} property.</p>
<h2 id="usage-notes">Usage notes</h2>
<p>Duplicate packets are detected when a packet has the same RTP sequence number as another packet that has previously been processed. Each time a packet is repeated, the value of <code>packetsDuplicated</code> is incremented, even if the same packet is received more than twice.</p>
<p>You can get a more accurate tally of how many packets have been lost on the stream by adding <code>packetsDuplicated</code> to {{domxref(“RTCInboundRtpSreamStats.packetsLost”, “packetsLost”)}}. The resulting value will be positive, although it will not match the count as computed in {{RFC(3660)}}.</p>
