<section> <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>
    For NFC terminology, please consult the
    <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/index.html#terminology">
    Web NFC specification</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/url-1/"><dfn>URL</dfn></a>
    </code> is defined in [[!URL]].
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#browsing-context">
    <dfn>browsing context</dfn></a> refers to the environment in which
    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document">Document</a> objects are
    presented to the user. A given <a>browsing context</a> has a single
    <a>origin</a> and a single <code>WindowProxy</code> object, but it
    can have many <code>Document</code> objects, with their associated
    <code>Window</code> objects. The <i>browsing context</i> identifies
    the entity which invokes this API, which can be a <i>web app</i>, a
    <i>web page</i>, or an
    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-iframe-element">iframe</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term
    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#origin">
    <dfn>origin</dfn></a> is defined in [[!HTML5]].
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-serialisation-of-an-origin">
    <dfn>ASCII serialized origin</dfn></a> is defined in [[!HTML5]].
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>NFC</b> stands for Near Field Communications, short-range wireless
    technology operating at 13.56 MHz which enables communication between
    devices at a distance less than 10 cm.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <dfn>NFC adapter</dfn> is the software entity in the underlying
    platform which provides access to NFC functionality implemented in a
    given hardware element (NFC chip). A device may have multiple NFC
    adapters, for instance a built-in one, and one attached via USB.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <dfn>NFC tag</dfn> is a passive NFC device.
    The <a>NFC tag</a> is powered by magnetic induction when an active NFC
    device is in proximity range. An <a>NFC tag</a> contains a single
    <a>NDEF message</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <dfn>NFC peer</dfn> is an active, powered device, which can interact
    with other devices in order to exchange data using NFC.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <dfn>NFC device</dfn> is either an <a>NFC peer</a>, or an <a>NFC tag</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <dfn>NDEF message</dfn> encapsulates one or more application-defined
    <a>NDEF record</a>s. <dfn>NDEF</dfn> is an abbreviation for NFC Forum
    Data Exchange Format, a lightweight binary message format. NDEF messages
    can be stored on an <a>NFC tag</a> or exchanged between NFC-enabled devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <dfn>NDEF record</dfn> has a maximum payload of 2^32-1 bytes. The record
    also contains information about the payload size, type, and an optional
    identifier. NFC Forum standardized a small set of useful data types to be
    used in <a>NDEF record</a>s, for instance text, URL, and binary data such as
    media. In addition, there are record types designed for more complex
    interactions, such as Smart Poster, and handover records.
  </p>
  <p>
    Part of the <a>NDEF record</a> is the <dfn>NDEF Id</dfn> field, which may or
    may not be present. If present, it contains a maximum 256 octets long
    string which is a URL and it is used for identifying the payload,
    in an application specific way.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <dfn>NFC content</dfn> is a synonym for <a>NDEF message</a>,
    which can originate either from an <a>NFC tag</a> or an <a>NFC peer</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <dfn>Web NFC origin</dfn> is the <a>ASCII serialized origin</a>
    of the <a>browsing context</a> that has written the <a>Web NFC message</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <dfn>Web NFC Id</dfn> is a special <a>URL</a> stored in the
    <a>Web NFC record</a>, and it is used for matching <a>NFC content</a> with
    URL patterns specified by listeners.
    For more details see the <a href="#web-nfc-id">Web NFC Id</a> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <dfn>Web NFC record</dfn> is a special <a>NDEF record</a> which identifies
    <a>Web NFC content</a> meant for web pages, rather than generic
    <a>NFC content</a>. For a detailed description see the
    <a href="#web-nfc-record-format">Web NFC record</a> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <dfn>Web NFC message</dfn> represents a set of the <a>NDEF record</a>s
    from a given <a>NDEF message</a> and a special <a>Web NFC record</a>.
    For more details see the <a href="#web-nfc-message-format">Web NFC Message
    format</a> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <dfn>Web NFC content</dfn> denotes all <a>Web NFC message</a>s
    contained in an <a>NDEF message</a>. This version of the specification
    supports one <a>Web NFC message</a> per <a>NDEF message</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <dfn>trusted integrity NFC content</dfn> refers to an
    <a>NDEF message</a>, or an <a>NDEF record</a>, which can be trusted for
    data integrity, i.e. the content is not changed by third party between
    writing and reading.
  </p>

  <p>
    The key security related definitions are the following.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <dfn>expressed permission</dfn> refers to an act by the user, e.g.
    via user interface or setting or host device platform features, using which
    the user approves the permission of a <a>browsing context</a> to access the
    given functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <dfn id="askforgiveness">ask for forgiveness</dfn> refers to some
    form of unobtrusive notification that informs the user of an operation
    while it is running.
    User agents SHOULD provide the user with means to ignore similar future
    operations from the same <a>origin</a> and advertise this to the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <dfn>prearranged trust relationship</dfn> means that the
    user agent has already established a trust relationship for a
    certain operation using a platform specific mechanism, so that an
    <a>expressed permission</a> from the user is not any more needed.
    See also the <a href="#prearranged-trust-relationship">
    Prearranged trust relationship</a> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    The term <dfn>obtain permission</dfn> for a certain operation indicates
    that the user agent has either obtained <a>expressed permission</a>, or
    <a href="#askforgiveness">asks for forgiveness</a>, or ensured a
    <a>prearranged trust relationship</a> exists.

<section class="informative"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    NFC technology involves multiple levels of security. Payments done with NFC
    are considered to be at least as secure as with payment cards at hardware
    level, but the whole software stack needs to be security hardened.
    However, data transfer (reads, writes and push) involve more threats. This
    document discusses some of the relevant threats and possible remedies, as
    input to API design and implementation decisions.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Security and privacy context of NFC</h2>
  <p>
    Discussions in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-nfc/issues">
    issues</a> such as in
    <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-nfc/issues/2">Verify security model</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-nfc/issues/3">Suggest a permission UI
    flow</a>, and
    <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-nfc/issues/40">Simplify process for
    obtaining permissions</a> make it clear that NFC technology has a few
    peculiarities with regards to content handling. In summary,
    <ul>
      <li>
        The user must make a physical act of tapping with an NFC capable device
        in order to use the technology. This action can also be involuntary,
        for instance by accidentally placing the NFC capable device in the
        proximity of an <a>NFC tag</a> or <a>NFC peer</a>.
        Therefore other means are also needed to make sure the NFC operation is
        according to the intentions of the user.
        For instance, the display must be on, the device must be unlocked,
        the <a>browsing context</a> using the NFC API must be visible and in
        focus, information about ongoing NFC operation should be visible (in the
        form of icons, information banners, etc).
      </li>
      <li id="ndef-integrity">
        The integrity of an <a>NDEF message</a> cannot be guaranteed, unless the
        <a>NFC content</a> is encrypted by applications.
        Therefore security policies cannot be based on the <a>NFC content</a>,
        since that can be changed by 3rd parties which are not using the
        Web NFC API.
        <p class="warning">
          For instance malicious 3rd parties can write arbitrary URL's into the
          <a>NDEF Id</a> field or to the <a>Web NFC Id</a>, and inject a
          prepared attack vector as data to services which use the Web NFC API
          as well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Since user agents cannot uniquely identify <a>NFC tag</a> or
        <a>NFC peer</a>s, there is no notion of "pairing" in communicating via
        NFC.
        Therefore each operation needs to <a>obtain permission</a> if required.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, there is no notion of "session" in communicating via NFC, other
        than the physical proximity range maintained by the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        The location of the user might indirectly be determined by knowing the
        physical location of the NFC tag which is being read.
        Also, the location of the user might be disclosed by sending
        <a>NFC tag</a>s, either by directly sharing the user location (when the
        <a>browsing context</a> has access to that), or by sending information
        that can be used for inferring the location of the user.
        Since both reading and sending <a>NFC content</a> might reveal the
        location of the user, user agents SHOULD take into account the
        security and privacy measures listed in the
        <a href="http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#security">
        Geolocation API</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Trust model</h2>
  <p>
    Web pages using the NFC API are not trusted.
    This means that the user needs to be aware of exactly what a web page is
    intending to do with NFC at any given moment. Also, implementations should
    make sure that when the user authorizes an NFC operation, then only that
    action is run, without side effects, and exactly in the context and the
    number of times the user allows the execution of NFC operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Web apps installed from a store, or web pages installed to home screen (with
    [[MANIFEST]]) MAY be considered trusted by the user agent.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Attacker model</h2>
  <p>
    The following patterns have been considered:
    <ul>
      <li>malicious web page and benign user: phishing user data</li>
      <li>malicious web page and benign user: phishing user location</li>
      <li>
        malicious web page prepared by malicious user: web page modifies
        existing NFC tag leading to indirect damage through fake identities
        and attack vectors
      </li>
      <li>malicious web page prepared by malicious user: destroying tags.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

          a web page can write only a tag which can be connected to its origin.
          Or, allow overwriting since tags not meant to be written can be
          protected by making them read only.

        </td>
        <td>
          A Web NFC tag SHOULD NOT ever trigger a user’s device to navigate

          granted permission.

  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Security policies</h2>
  <p>
    In order to minimize attack surface using the Web NFC API, user agents MAY
    implement multiple security policies, for example some of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        User agents SHOULD allow Web NFC API access only from top level frames
        or frames where the integrity and origin of the content is secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to use NFC, a website MUST be visible and in focus. For
        web pages in background, receiving and sending NFC data MUST be
        suspended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading of generic NFC content is allowed, if the reading page scheme is
        https.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, reading of generic NFC content is not allowed, only special
        Web NFC content can be read.
      </li>
      <li>
        Writing (pushing) is allowed only with special Web NFC content when
        the writing page origin fulfills certain conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The payload data on NFC content is untrusted, and SHOULD NOT be used
        by the user agent to do automatic handling such as opening a web page
        with a URL found in an NFC tag, unless the user approves that.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since all local content that a web page has access to can be shared with
        NFC, the user needs to be clearly aware about the permissions granted
        to the web page using the Web NFC API.
      </li>
    </ul>
    The Web NFC API specification may require the existence of some of the
    policies above, and may make others optional. However, all the mechanisms
    needed to implement these security policies should be supported by the
    implementations.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Security mechanisms</h2>
  <p>
    In order to support security policies concerning the Web NFC API, certain
    mechanisms are recommended for the implementations, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        An identification mechanism for telling apart “Web NFC content" from
        generic NFC content.
      </li>
      <li>
        A mechanism for conveying implementation specific metadata
        which is not exposed to applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        A mechanism for obtaining <a>expressed permission</a> of the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        A mechanism for <a>ask for forgiveness</a> policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        A mechanism for <a>prearranged trust relationship</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <section> <h3>Prearranged trust relationship</h3>
  <p>
    In order to <a>obtain permission</a> to a Web NFC function, either an
    <a>expressed permission</a> is needed (essentially a user prompt or
    setting), or the functionality has such low security and privacy impact that
    displaying information about the ongoing operation is considered enough
    (also known as <a>ask for forgiveness</a>), or then a
    <a>prearranged trust relationship</a> MUST be established by using specific
    mechanisms of the underlying platform, and by choices made in the
    implementation of the user agent.
    A few examples for prearranged trust relationship are given below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Web apps installed from a store, or web pages installed to home screen (with
    [[MANIFEST]]) MAY be considered trusted by the user agent. In this case
    the trust concerns the client web page, but not to the date exchanged
    through NFC.
  </p>
  <p>
    For trusting the integrity of the data exchanged via NFC, user agents MAY
    use encrypted <a>NFC content</a> with key management based on Public Key
    Infrastructure. Key management is out of the scope of the Web NFC
    specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the risk of 3rd party native applications modifying and faking tags is
    considered a problem deferred to native application stores, just like the
    issue whether the user can trust a browser implementation or not, then
    in this case user agents MAY make the choice of trusting the
    data content of NFC tags and peers, and this MAY be considered a
    <a>prearranged trust relationship</a> in the Web NFC API.
    In that case, user agents MAY consider the <a>Web NFC Id</a> and
    the <a>Web NFC record</a> as trusted information, so that origin based
    browser security policies MAY be based on them.
    Specifically, user prompting policies MAY be relaxed when the <a>origin</a>
    of the <a>browsing context</a> requesting the Web NFC functionality is
    equal to the the one saved in the <a>Web NFC Id</a> and optionally when it
    matches the URL patterns saved in the access control list of
    <a>Web NFC record</a> payload.
    This kind of prearranged trust relationship can be applied in the case
    when the user agent wants to minimize or eliminate user prompts
    involved in obtaining permissions, and is able to mitigate the involved
    risks in other ways.

<section class="informative"> <h2>Implementation details</h2>
  <p>
    This section contains discussion of implementation possibilities of security
    related mechanisms. The following implementation alternatives are possible:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use additional NDEF records in an NDEF message, containing
        metadata specific to Web NFC specific, such as identification, and
        whitelists for reading and writing.
      </li>
        Use a specific Web NFC record format and encode the metadata specific to
        Web NFC into that.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <section> <h3>Whitelists and the <strong>NfcAccess</strong> dictionary</h3>
    <p>
      A <dfn>whitelist</dfn> is an array of <code>NfcAccess</code>
      dictionaries.
    </p>
    <dl title="dictionary NfcAccess" class="idl">
      <dt>USVString scope</dt>
      <dt>boolean canWrite</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The <dfn id="widl-NfcAccess-scope">scope</dfn> property is a string
      pattern for matching the URL's that are explicitly allowed to access
      the data, for instance <br>
      <code>{ "scope": "https://mydomain.com", "canWrite": "true"}</code>. <br>
      Scopes which don't
      <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/#the-within-scope-algorithm">match</a> this are not permitted to access the data.
      If the whitelist is empty, then the platform default policy applies,
      which SHOULD permit reading for everyone, but SHOULD prevent writing,
      except to URL's which
      <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/#the-within-scope-algorithm">match</a> the origin of the page which wrote the existing data.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <dfn id="widl-NfcAccess-canWrite">canWrite</dfn> property is
      <code>true</code>, then the URL's matching <code><var>scope</var></code>
      are permitted to write (in fact, update) the data, otherwise they are only permitted to read it.
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
      The exact meaning of scope, pattern, and the matching algorithm to origins
      need to be reviewed with the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Application Security WG</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section> <h3>Additional NDEF records for Web NFC</h3>
    <p>
      A typical Web NFC NDEF message will contain the following
      NDEF records:
      <ul>
        <li>Normal NDEF records carrying data.</li>
        <li>
          Optionally, an NDEF record for Web NFC identification and configuration.
          The preferred type of this NDEF record is NFC Forum External Type
          (TNF=0x04), with the External Type field set to
          <code>urn:nfc:ext:w3.org:webnfc</code>. The payload of this record
          MAY contain implementation specific data (such as tokens, keys,
          context, etc).
        </li>
      </ul>
      This scheme allows that legacy readers could read the data records,
      provided they are able to ignore the Web NFC specific record.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section> <h3>Web NFC using encoded metadata</h3>
    <p>
      As an alternative to the previous section, Web NFC may also define a
      record format based on NFC Forum External Type (TNF=0x04) records, where
      the External Type field set to <code>urn:nfc:ext:w3.org:webnfc</code>.
      The payload type is <code>application/webnfc+json</code> (encoded as
      UTF-8 by default). All data is JSON, with the following schema:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>id</code>: <code>"string"</code>; contains the Web NFC
          identifier, e.g. the SHA256 signature of
          <code>"w3.org/web-nfc”</code>. This is not strictly needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>origin</code>: <code>"string"</code>; contains the
          <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#ascii-serialisation-of-an-origin">ASCII serialized origin</a> which
          has written the data. Also, this is not strictly needed, since it can
          be also stored at the NDEF record's <code>id</code> field.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>messageType</code>: <code>"string"</code>; contains the type of
          the data, either <code>"text"</code>, <code>"url"</code>,
          <code>"json"</code>, or <code>"blob"</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>message</code>: <code>"string"</code>; contains the payload data
          encoded as text (text, URL and JSON), and for blob encoded as
          Base64 ([[RFC4648]]).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>access</code>: <code>"array"</code>; contains the
          <a>whitelist</a> for defining access control to the data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The full JSON schema is the following:
      <pre title = "Web NFC JSON schema" class="example">
        {
          "$schema": "http://w3.org/web-nfc#",

                  "properties": {
                    "scope": {
                      "id": "http://w3.org/web-nfc/access/0/scope",
                      "type": "string"
                    },
                    "canWrite": {
                      "id": "http://w3.org/web-nfc/access/0/canWrite",
                      "type": "boolean"
                    }`
                  }
                },
              ]
            }
          },
          "required": [

            "messageType",
            "message",
          ]
        }
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      The encoded JSON format for Web NFC data and metadata is useful for
      abstracting away NFC Forum types, and for supporting implementations where
      an NDEF message contains only one NDEF record.
