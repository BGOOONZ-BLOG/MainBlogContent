         <h1>Overview</h1>

         <section id="sec-purpose-scope" class="informative">
            <h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>

            <p>This specification, EPUB Accessibility, addresses two key needs in the EPUB® ecosystem:</p>

            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>evaluation and certification of accessible EPUB Publications;</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>discovery of the accessible qualities of EPUB Publications.</p>
               </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Although it has always been possible to create <a>EPUB Publications</a> with a high degree of accessibility,
               this specification sets formal requirements to meet to certify content as accessible. These requirements
               provide <a>Authors</a> a clear set of guidelines to evaluate their content against, and allow certification of
               quality.</p>

            <p>The inclusion of accessibility metadata, on the other hand, facilitates informed decisions about the usability
               of an EPUB Publication. Consumers can review the qualities of the content and decide whether an EPUB
               Publication is appropriate for their needs, regardless of whether it meets the bar of being certified broadly
               accessible.</p>

            <p>This specification defines three categories of compliance for EPUB Publications:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p id="discoverable">Discoverable — an EPUB Publication that meets the discovery metadata requirements of
                     this specification but does not meet the accessibility requirements. Conformance is defined in <a
                        href="#sec-conf-discovery">Discoverable EPUB Publications</a>.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p id="accessible">Accessible — an EPUB Publication that meets all discovery, [[WCAG20]] and EPUB
                     accessibility requirements. Conformance is defined in <a href="#sec-conf-epub">Accessible EPUB
                        Publications</a>.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p id="optimized">Optimized — an EPUB Publication that meets the discovery requirements for <a
                        data-lt="Optimized EPUB Publication">Optimizations</a>. Conformance is defined in <a
                        href="#sec-conf-opt">Optimized EPUB Publications</a>.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This specification does not target a single version of EPUB. It is designed to be applicable to EPUB
               Publications that conform to any version or profile, including future versions of the standard.</p>

            <p>Ideally, these guidelines will be instructive in evaluating any digital publication built on Open Web
               technologies, although ensuring such application is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

            <div class="note">
               <p>For additional background on the decisions that went into this specification, refer to the informative
                  [[AccessibilityFAQ]].</p>

         <section id="sec-success-techniques">
            <h2>Success Techniques</h2>

            <p>This specification takes an abstract approach to the accessibility requirements for <a>EPUB Publications</a>,
               similar to how [[!WCAG20]] separates its accessibility guidelines from the techniques to achieve them. This
               approach allows the guidelines to remain stable even as the format evolves.</p>

            <p>To facilitate this approach, the companion [[!EPUBAccessibilityTechniques]] document outlines conformance
               techniques. The techniques explain how to meet the requirements of this specification for different versions
               of EPUB.</p>

         <section id="sec-application" class="informative">
            <h2>Application to Older Specifications</h2>

            <p>This specification is designed to be applicable to any <a>EPUB Publication</a>, even if the content conforms
               to an older specification that does not make reference to this one (i.e., specifications prior to
               [[EPUB31]]).</p>

            <p><a>Authors</a> of such EPUB Publications are encouraged to create content in conformance with the
               accessibility requirements of this specification, even though it is not normatively required.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Unlike Web pages, <a>EPUB Publications</a> are designed to be distributed through many channels for personal
               consumption — a model that has made EPUB a successful format for ebooks and other types of digital
               publications. A consequence of this model, however, is that specific details about the accessibility of a
               publication need to travel with it.</p>

            <p>An online bookstore aggregating content from publishers and authors, for example, does not know the production
               quality that went into each submission, so can only convey to consumers what is present in each publication's
               metadata.</p>

            <p>Ensuring that the accessible qualities of an EPUB Publication can be discovered by any interested party is
               therefore a primary concern. Users need to be able to gauge the usability of an EPUB Publication when they
               purchase, borrow or otherwise obtain it, a determination that requires knowing the any affordances made to

            <p>Similarly, content that does not meet the requirements of this specification, while not broadly accessible,
               might still meet the needs of individual users. Only through the inclusion of rich metadata can a user

         <section id="sec-access-pub-intro" class="informative">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>EPUB is built on the Open Web Platform, with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG the core technologies used for
               content authoring. The use of these technologies means that <a>EPUB Publications</a> can be authored with a
               high degree of accessibility simply through the proper application of established Web accessibility
               techniques.</p>

            <p>The primary source for the production of accessible Web content is the W3C Web Content Accessibility
               Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 [[WCAG20]]. This specification leverages the extensive work done in [[!WCAG20]] to
               establish benchmarks for accessible content, and the same four high-level content principles — Perceivable,
               Operable, Understandable and Robust — are central to creating accessible EPUB Publications.</p>

            <p>This section defines how to apply the conformance criteria defined in [[WCAG20]] and also addresses qualities
               unique to EPUB Publications.</p>

            <p>EPUB Publications authored to comply with the requirements in this section will have a high degree of
               accessibility for users with a wide variety of reading needs and preferences.</p>

         </section>

         <section id="sec-rel-wcag" class="informative">
            <h2>Relationship to WCAG</h2>

            <p>[[WCAG20]] and [[WCAG20-TECHS]] provide extensive coverage of issues and solutions for Web content
               accessibility — from tables to embedded multimedia to rich semantics. They represent the foundation that this
               specification builds upon.</p>

            <p>This specification does not repeat the requirements or techniques introduced in those documents, as it risks
               breaking compatibility between the two standards (e.g., putting guidance out of sync, or in conflict). At the
               same time, although the requirements are not individually called out, it does not diminish their importance in
               creating accessible <a>EPUB Publications</a>.</p>

            <p>This specification instead adds an <a href="#sec-access-pub">additional set of requirements for EPUB
                  Publications</a>. These requirements are no more or less important than those covered in WCAG; they are
               simply necessary to follow for EPUB Publications. (The relationship to WCAG is explained for each requirement
               in its respective section.)</p>

            <p>The same is true of the techniques in the [[EPUBAccessibilityTechniques]] document. It provides coverage of
               techniques that are unique to EPUB Publications, or that need clarification in the context of an EPUB
               Publication. It does not mean that the rest of the WCAG techniques are not applicable.</p>

            <p>As a result, although this section can be read without deep knowledge of WCAG conformance, to implement the
               accessibility requirements of this specification will require an understanding of [[WCAG20]].</p>

            <div class="note">
               <p>Because this specification adds requirements that are not a part of WCAG, an EPUB Publication can conform
                  to [[WCAG20]] without conforming to this specification. An EPUB Publication that does not meet <a
                     href="#sec-epub-req">the requirements for EPUB Publications</a> is not accessible to this specification,
                  however.</p>
               <p>The IDPF plans to work with W3C and the Web Accessibility Initiative to harmonize the requirements for EPUB
                  Publications with WCAG.</p>

               <p><a>EPUB Publications</a> MUST meet [[!WCAG20]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-reqs"
                     >Level A</a> to be conformant with this specification, but it is RECOMMENDED that they meet <a
                     href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance-reqs">Level AA</a>.</p>

               <p>Although this specification only requires Level A conformance, local and national laws can influence the
                  level of conformance an EPUB Publication has to meet to be considered accessible. Level AA conformance is
                  often cited as the benchmark for accessibility in legal frameworks and policies, for example. Additionally,
                  any procurer or distributor of EPUB Publications can demand higher conformance requirements than the
                  baseline defined here.</p>

               <p><a>Authors</a> consequently need to ensure they understand the requirements their content has to meet to be
                  considered accessible in any jurisdiction or distribution context, including seeking any necessary legal
                  advice. Minimum conformance with this specification does not supersede such requirements, and does not
                  offer protection from any legal liability that might arise.</p>

                  <h4>Page and Publication</h4>

                  <p>The [[!WCAG20]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#guidelines">Principles</a> focus on the
                     evaluation of individual <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#webpagedef">Web pages</a>, but an
                        <a>EPUB Publication</a> more closely resembles what [[!WCAG20]] refers to as a <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#set-of-web-pagesdef">set of Web pages</a>: "[a] collection of Web
                     pages that share a common purpose".</p>

                  <p>Consequently, when evaluating the accessibility of an EPUB Publication, individual pages — or <a
                        data-lt="EPUB Content Documents">Content Documents</a>, as they are known in EPUB nomenclature —
                     cannot be reviewed in isolation. Rather, their overall accessibility as parts of a larger work also has
                     to be evaluated.</p>

                  <p>For example, it is not sufficient for individual Content Documents to have a logical reading order if
                     the publication presents them in the wrong order. Likewise, including a title for every Content Document
                     is complementary to providing a title for the publication: the overall accessibility is affected if
                     either is missing.</p>

                  <p>The [[!WCAG20]] guidelines for content to be <em>perceivable</em>, <em>operable</em>,
                        <em>understandable</em> and <em>robust</em> therefore MUST be evaluated against the full EPUB
                     Publication, not only to each Content Document within it.</p>

                  <p>More information about applying these guidelines to EPUB Publications is available in the

                  <p>Provide navigation to static page break locations.</p>

                  <h4>Understanding this Objective</h4>

                  <p>Statically paginated content is still ubiquitous, as print continues to be the most consumed medium for
                     books both among the general reading public and in educational settings. Print is not the only source of
                     static pagination, either: static page boundaries are also present in fixed-layout digital
                     publications.</p>

                  <p>As a result, a non-visual reader in an environment where statically-paginated content is used is
                     disadvantaged relative to his or her peers by not being able to easily locate the same locations in the
                     publication (e.g., if a teacher instructs students to all turn to a specific page).</p>

                  <p>The inclusion of page boundary locations helps bridge this disparity by ensuring that those using
                     reflowable media are not disadvantaged by their choice.</p>

                  <p>Providing page navigation also helps in reflowable publications that do not have a statically paginated
                     equivalent. The default pagination of these publications by Reading Systems is not static, since it
                     changes depending on the viewport size and user's font settings. As a result, coordinating locations
                     among users of the same <a>EPUB Publication</a> can be complicated without static references.</p>

                  <h4>Objective</h4>

                  <p>Structure Media Overlays to provide more accessible playback experiences.</p>

                  <h4>Understanding this Objective</h4>

                  <p>Media Overlays provide an accessible playback experience for anyone who benefits from having text and
                     audio synchronized. They are also useful to users who only require audio playback, or only benefit from
                     reading with text highlighting. Media Overlays also enable a seamless playback experience from beginning
                     to end of an EPUB Publication for all these users.</p>

                  <p>The most basic <a

                        Overlay Documents</a> [[MediaOverlays]] provide only minimal instructions to Reading Systems,
                     however. They indicate the text to highlight and the audio clip that corresponds to the text. The result
                     is that users only have basic start and stop options available.</p>

                  <p>Authors need to add structure and semantics to Media Overlay Documents to allow Reading Systems to
                     present more usable experiences. With richer markup, a Reading System could provide the ability to skip
                     past secondary content that interferes with the primary narrative, escape users from deeply nested
                     structures like tables, and allow them to navigate through the sections of the publication without
                     having to go to the table of contents.</p>

         <h1>Optimized Publications</h1>

         <p>Although [[!WCAG20]] provides a general set of guidelines for making content broadly accessible, conformant
            content is not always optimal for specific user groups. Conversely, content optimized for a specific need or
            reading modality is often not conformant to [[!WCAG20]] because it is not designed for a broad audience.</p>

         <p>For example, an <a>EPUB Publication</a> with synchronized text and audio might contain a full audio recording of
            the content but limit the text content to only the major headings. In this case, the EPUB Publication is
            consumable by users who needs to hear the content (i.e., they can listen to the full publication and can navigate
            between headings), but it is not usable by anyone who cannot hear the audio.</p>

         <p>In other words, when an EPUB Publication is optimized for specific reading modalities, the failure to achieve a
            WCAG conformance level does not make it any less accessible to the intended audience.</p>

         <p>To account for this discrepancy, this specification places importance on the inclusion of discovery metadata. An
               <a>Optimized EPUB Publication</a> is discoverable to its intended audience through the inclusion of rich
            metadata, even if it is not identified as broadly accessible per this specification.</p>

         <p>In addition to the metadata requirements defined in <a href="#sec-discovery"><em>Discovery</em></a>, an optimized
            EPUB Publication MUST identify the standard or guidelines the content adheres to in a
               [[!DCTERMS]] <code>conformsTo</code> property. The value of this property MUST be an IRI [[!RFC3987]] that
            references the standard or guidelines it follows.</p>

         <aside class="example">
            <p>The following example shows a conformance statement for an EPUB 3 Publication that conforms to the

         <h1>Distribution</h1>

         <p>The creation of an accessible <a>EPUB Publication</a> does not in itself guarantee that the content will be
            obtainable or consumable by users. Depending on the <a>Distribution System</a> used, other factors will influence
            the overall accessibility of the EPUB Publication.</p>

         <p>This specification distinguishes factors that an <a>Author</a> has influence over from those that they do not.
            For example, an accessible interface for locating and obtaining content is an essential part of the distribution
            process, as is the ability to search and review accessibility metadata. Such interfaces are typically out of the
            control of content Authors, however, as distribution of EPUB Publications is often done through third parties.
            But even when Authors control their Distribution Channel, the accessibility of these applications is outside the
            scope of this specification, as such considerations are not appplicable to the EPUB Publications themselves.</p>

         <p>At the same time, there are decisions Authors have to make when their content is ingested into Distribution
            Systems, such as what digital rights to apply. Although these decisions are not part of the preparation of the
            content, their potential impact on users requires special attention.</p>

         <p>To minimize the effects of distribution on accessibility, Authors therefore MUST adhere to the following
            distribution practices:</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Although this specification focuses on content requirements for accessible <a>EPUB Publications</a>, there are
               two additional considerations in making EPUB Publications available to everyone: the ability for anyone to be
               able to create an EPUB Publication and the ability for anyone to consume the content.</p>

            <p>Although these needs are not the primary focus of this specification, this appendix provides conformance
               requirements for the creation of accessible <a data-lt="EPUB Authoring Tool">Authoring Tools</a>,
                  <a>Distribution Systems</a> and <a>Reading Systems</a>. Developers who meet or exceed these requirements
               will make their applications usable by a wide variety of users.</p>

            <div class="note">
               <p>This appendix could be superseded by specifications dedicated to these concerns in the future.</p>
