1.  Introduction

   The Content Security Policy specification [CSP] defines a mechanism
   by which web developers can control the resources which a particular
   page can fetch or execute, as well as a number of security-relevant
   policy decisions.

   The policy language specified in that document consists of an
   extensible set of "directives", each of which controls a specific
   resource type or policy decision.  This specification establishes a
   registry to ensure that extensions to CSP are listed and
   standardized.

2.  Use of the Registry

   Content Security Policy directives must be documented in a readily
   available public specification in order to be registered by IANA.
   This documentation must fully explain the syntax, intended usage, and
   semantics of the directive.  The intent of this requirement is to
   assure interoperable independent implementations, and to prevent
   accidental namespace collisions between implementations of dissimilar
   features.

   Documents defining new Content Security Policy directives must
   register them with IANA, as described in Section 3.  The IANA
   registration policy for such parameters is "Specification Required"
   [RFC5226], and is further discussed in Section 3.2.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification creates a new top-level IANA registry named
   "Content Security Policy directives".

3.1.  Content Security Policy directives Registry

   New Content Security Policy directives, and updates to existing
   directives, must be registered with IANA.

   When registering a new Content Security Policy directive, the
   following information must be provided:

   o  The directive's name, an ASCII string conforming to the
      "directive-name" rule specified in Section 4.1 of [CSP].  The ABNF
      [RFC5234] is as follows:



   directive-name  = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )

   o  A reference to the readily available public specification defining
      the new directive's syntax, usage, and semantics.

   The following table contains the initial values for this registry:

                      +-----------------+-----------+
                      | Directive Name  | Reference |
                      +-----------------+-----------+
                      | base-uri        | [CSP]     |
                      | child-src       | [CSP]     |
                      | connect-src     | [CSP]     |
                      | default-src     | [CSP]     |
                      | font-src        | [CSP]     |
                      | form-action     | [CSP]     |
                      | frame-ancestors | [CSP]     |
                      | frame-src       | [CSP]     |
                      | img-src         | [CSP]     |
                      | media-src       | [CSP]     |
                      | object-src      | [CSP]     |
                      | plugin-types    | [CSP]     |
                      | report-uri      | [CSP]     |
                      | sandbox         | [CSP]     |
                      | script-src      | [CSP]     |
                      | style-src       | [CSP]     |
                      +-----------------+-----------+

3.2.  Registration Policy for Content Security Policy directives

   The registration policy for Content Security Policy directives is
   "Specification Required" [RFC5226], which uses a designated expert to
   review the specification.

   The designated expert, when deliberating on whether to include a new
   directive in the registry, should consider the following criteria.
   This is not an exhaustive list, but representative of the issues to
   consider when rendering a decision):

   o  Content Security Policy is a restrictive feature, which allows web
      developers to deny themselves access to resources and APIs which
      would otherwise be available.  Deploying Content Security Policy
      is, therefore, a strict reduction in risk.  The expert should
      carefully consider whether proposed directives would violate this
      property.

   o  Granular directives are valuable, but the expert should strive to
      strike a reasonable balance between providing developers with all
      the knobs and switches possible, and providing only those with
      known security implications.

4.  Security Considerations

   The registry in this document does not in itself have security
   implications.  The directives specified, however, certainly do.  The
   documents referenced when registering new directives must contain
   detailed security and privacy considerations sections, and should
   contain usage information which informs web developers as to the
   directive's expected implementation.
