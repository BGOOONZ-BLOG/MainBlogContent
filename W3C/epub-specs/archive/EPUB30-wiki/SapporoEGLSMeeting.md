The closest hotel is Acsent Inn Sapporo.  It
takes from this hotel to the meeting location
less than 10 minutes by foot.  No other hotels
are in walking distance.

  * (Chinese) http://www.tabimado.net.cn/hotelinfo/18487

The number of rooms available in this hotel is less than
20, since it is a small hotel.  If you do need a room
in this hotel, make a reservation as soon as possible.

Information about other hotels are available at many
web sites including the two sites shown above.

This hotel is fully booked as of July 12.  You might want to
try [Shin-Sapporo ARC City Hotel](http://www.arccityhotel.com/english.html), which is close to New Sapporo station.  It takes 14 min from this station to Higashi
Sapporo, and then 8 min from Higashi Sapporo station to Sapporo
Convention Center.


You might want to try hotels close to Odori station.
They are much more convenient for sightseeing and
are even closer to the meeting location.  However,
three subway lines are available in this station (I'm sure
you can find information in English).  If you are not like
me (i.e., you are not lost always), you might want to try hotels around
Odori station such as
