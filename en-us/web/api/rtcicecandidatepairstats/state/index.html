<p>The <strong><code>state</code></strong> property in an {{domxref(“RTCIceCandidatePairStats”)}} object indicates the state of the check list of which the candidate pair is a member.</p>

<p>A {{domxref(“DOMString”)}} whose value is one of those found in the {{domxref(“RTCStatsIceCandidatePairState”)}} enumerated type.</p>
<h2 id="ice-check-lists">ICE check lists</h2>
<p>During ICE negotiation, the ICE layer builds up a <strong>check list</strong>, which is a list of potential pairings of ICE candidates. Each pair has a state, whose value is represented by <code>RTCStatsIceCandidatePairState</code>.</p>

<p>When a candidate pair is added to the check list, it begins in the <code>frozen</code> state. As soon as there are no checks ongoing which block the pair from being analyzed, it is unfrozen and moves into the <code>waiting</code> state. This may happen immediately upon being added to the check list.</p>
<p>Each time a candidate pair is done being checked, the next-highest priority candidate pair remaining on the check list moves from the <code>waiting</code> state to the <code>in-progress</code> state, and its check begins. If the check fails for any reason, the pair moves into its final state, <code>failed</code>. If the check succeeds, the pair ends up in the <code>succeeded</code> state.</p>
<p>The ICE check list state for any given pair of ICE candidates can be found in the corresponding the <code>state</code> property.</p>
