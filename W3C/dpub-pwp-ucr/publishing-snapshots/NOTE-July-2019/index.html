			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p> Publications, from corporate memos to newsletters to electronic books to scholarly journal articles,
				must be considered first-class content on the Web, equal to the more common forms of Web pages available
				today. This document describes the various use cases highlighting the problems users and publishers face
				when these publications are to be used in a digital, Web environment. The requirements that come from
				those use cases provide the basis for the technical considerations in a companion document, currently
				entitled “Web Publications”&nbsp;[<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-wpub" title="Web Publications"

					href="#introduction"></a></h2>
			<p> The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely joined by hyperlinks. Clustering
				within domains and with explicit navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites.
				Despite the Web's strong connections to print media (e.g. web resources are “pages” and the in-memory
				model for Web applications is the “Document Object Model”), this document argues that the web platform
				may still not be meeting certain requirements from print media that users desire. </p>
			<p> Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines, pamphlets of long-form articles
				and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics, notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different
				manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media, made public. </p>
			<p> Another form of publication that also has a long history in both the printed as well as the digital
				world are documents. These are publications that are written and distributed in a more ad-hoc manner,
				such as legal briefs, corporate memos, and even the definitions of standards, such as this content
				currently being read. </p>
			<p> We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition of portable, bounded publications with
				the pervasive accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New
				models of economic sustainability and innovative experiences of knowledge depend on this. </p>
			<p> It is the task of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> to explore the uniqueness,
				desirability, and feasibility of bringing these two great models of publishing together. This document
				explores requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios. Requirements for
				publications on the Web are explored first, without referring to any packaging aspect that would
				correspond to current practices like EPUB. This is followed by requirements of those packaging aspects,
				as a structure on top of a purely Web-based distribution. The complete list of requirements is also
				collected in <a href="#reqtable">a separate table</a> in an appendix. </p>

					able to make use of all features offered by the Open Web Platform (OWP). </p>
				<p> There is a remarkable development of tools and frameworks built on top of OWP that make it possible
					to develop powerful interactive layers on top of OWP. These include, for example, data visualization
					systems (e.g., d3, built on top of SVG), possibilities to access external services like Wolfram
					Alpha, or tools to create and store (possibly as part of the publication) annotations. These tools
					have been traditionally developed around browsers and provide possibilities that publications should
					also benefit from. That requires that <a data-lt="Web Publication" href="#dfn-web-publication"

					<li id="uc_owp_tools"><a href="#uc_owp_tools">UC&nbsp;1</a>: A large, multidisciplinary, Web-based
						journal relies on traditional Web technologies like HTML and CSS for its content. The journal,
						responding to the evolving expectations of its audience, is increasingly using additional media
						such as video, audio, animated graphics, and very large images; the trend is to consider these
						as integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a result needs access to the latest
						visualization and other data management tools that the OWP-based tools can offer. </li>
					<li id="uc_owp_lms"><a href="#uc_owp_lms">UC&nbsp;2</a>: Educational publications are increasingly
						making use of OWP features. In addition to video, audio, and animations, they may also include
						interactive exams (possibly linked to online evaluation facilities), visualization of data or of
						algorithms, and built-in interpreters for various languages (e.g., for courses on programming).
						In many respects, the borderline between these publications and Web applications is becoming
						fuzzy. </li>

				<p id="r_horizdep" class="req-set cc-minimal"><a href="#r_horizdep">Req.&nbsp;2</a>: A Web Publication
					should conform to the requirements of all horizontal dependencies: accessibility,
					internationalization, device independence, security, and privacy. </p>
				<p> Web content has to be consumed under different circumstances: it must be available to the largest
					possible audience in a secure manner, providing the necessary protection of the reader’s privacy.
					Publication content must be able to answer to a number of principles like accessibility,
					internationalization, device independence, security, and privacy. (These are usually referred to, in
					the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> context, as “horizontal” dependencies.) These
					principles are, in general terms: </p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Accessibility:</dt>
					<dd> People with disabilities should be able to access the content of a publication. They should be
						able to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well as contribute to it.
						Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the content, including visual,
						auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. </dd>
					<dt>Internationalization:</dt>
					<dd> Publications should be well adapted to any language, writing systems, region, or culture. This
						includes the usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left, horizontal or vertical
						writing; item numbering, or interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of the right
						character sets and of local typographic conventions. </dd>
					<dt>Device Independence:</dt>
					<dd> The content in a publication should be usable on a large number of devices with very different
						device characteristics: different screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying
						level of processing power, etc. These different affordances should be automatic with no, or very
						little, user intervention. </dd>
					<dt>Security:</dt>
					<dd> Publications should be presented by a User Agent using a security model that is at least (if
						not more) secure than the standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/runtime/">Web security
							model</a>. Doing this will prevent publications that contain malicious attacks, data theft,
						and other security incidents from impacting users by jeopardizing the integrity of the
						underlying data or machine operations. </dd>
					<dt>Privacy:</dt>
					<dd> The content in a publication should maintain and support user privacy, in spite of the fact
						that the evolution of online technologies has increased the possibility for the collection and
						processing of personal, and possibly sensitive, data. However, since a publication may use <a
							href="#r_owp">any part of the OWP</a>, it may choose to use functionality such as the
						ability to track a user's activity within the publication. </dd>
				</dl>
				<p> These principles correspond to technical requirements on the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and
					its possible extension to Web Publications) insofar as the technologies must empower the authors
					(writers, editors, publishers, etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether authors use the
					possibilities of these technologies or not is not addressed in this document. </p>
				<p> All these constraints are formalized in the context of the usage on the Web and by extension Web
					Publications. This means that they are valid for publications in general. In some cases, for example
					due to legislative reasons, the demands on publications may be more stringent than for generic Web
					sites. The use cases below provide some examples for the publication-specific situations. Note also
					that some aspect of horizontal dependencies (e.g., accessibility or security), are also the subject
					of further use cases and requirements elsewhere in this document. </p>

					the constituent resources of a Web Publication must be easily discovered and there should be a way
					to differentiate between essential and non-essential resources. </p>
				<p> A Web Publication will likely be composed of multiple Web documents and their resources. A more
					complicated Web Publication may have many resources, some of which are essential and some of which
					are not. Because of this complexity, extracting in advance all the references to some or all
					constituent resources may be prohibitive. It is therefore necessary for the user agent to have an
					easy access to the list of constituent resources and some of their characteristics, such as media
					type, size, and whether they are essential. </p>
				<p> In a publication, some content is essential to the user being able to consume it while other content
					could be either absent or have a provided fallback for situations such as limited connectivity or
					storage. This information, provided by the author or publisher of the Web Publication, would enable
					a user agent to provide a better experience to the user. For example, the user agent can ensure that
					essential resources are made available when offline (see <a href="#offline" class="sec-ref"
							>§&nbsp;<span class="secno">4.5 </span>Offline</a>). </p>
				<ul class="use-cases">

						long-form narrative on a device with limited storage: a publication filled with text, images,
						audio, and multimedia files. Nick also rides the subway where he loses Internet connectivity
						frequently and without warning for long stretches of time. During offline or low-storage
						situations, there are still critical parts of the publication that are consumable, mainly the
						text (and possibly images). Having a reasonable fallback for video, such as a poster image or
						placeholder image, would allow Nick to read the content while offline or on a device with
						limited storage. </li>

						accessible descriptions when internet connectivity is not optimum. </li>
					<li id="uc_const-res_essential_font"><a href="#uc_const-res_essential_font">UC&nbsp;33</a>: Gösta is

						marked the dataset as non-essential for conveying the results of the paper and therefore

						the value of the stock as it was the last time she opened the publication. It should be possible
						for either the content itself or the user agent to provide some user experience that notifies
						her that the currently presented data is a week old. </li>
					<li id="uc_const-res_database_access"><a href="#uc_const-res_database_access">UC&nbsp;36</a>: Risha
						publishes an article which includes an interactive component that accesses a database, exposed
						to the Web via a RESTful API. The interactive component is implemented as a JavaScript library.
						Such data cannot be included in a packaged publication and the interactive module is of no use
						without such data. Risha therefore marks the Web Publication component relative to the
						interactive module as not essential when offline. </li>
					<li id="uc_const-res_non-essential"><a href="#uc_const-res_non-essential">UC&nbsp;37</a>: Chiara is
						listening to an audiobook on Roman history. The description when she bought it mentioned that
						the maps and images referred to the book were available as supplemental content in the file. At

						audiobook better, but it is marked as non-essential if the audiobook is taken offline. </li>

						Stephanie, a student, is answering questions in an assessment embedded in a Web Publication. Her

				<p> We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of which have survived with
					little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital documents are unlikely to persist without more
					active interventions, such as making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating
					integrity. Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user group, it is
					desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the inherent durability that
					characterizes print artifacts. Packaged Web Publications offer this potential by making it easier
					for archiving services to locate, harvest, update, and describe digital publications. Long-term
					preservation of digital publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible beyond the
					tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing platforms. </p>
				<p> Fundamental use cases and requirements already help aid our archiving requirements (<i>e.g.,</i>
