1. flowed content buffer

a vector of elements E as follows:

* if (dtf/character? E) then
	E is a styled content character

* if (dtf/line-break? E) then
	E is an explicit line break

* if (dtf/space? E) then
	E is a reference to a dtf/space structure

2. flowed presentation region (area)

a vector of elements E as follows:

* if (dtf/glyph? E) then
	E denotes a glyph area

* if (dtf/marker? E) then
	E denotes the a marker

3. dtf/marker

a dtf/marker is either a dtf/content-marker or a dtf/area-marker

a dtf/content-marker is an enumeration as follows:

{
  CHARACTER,
  WORD
}

within the context of a flowed presentation region, a (dtf/content-marker 'CHARACTER) is not expressed, but is implied at
the boundary of each character code

a dtf/area-marker is an enumeration as follows:

{
  GLYPH,
  INLINE,
  LINE,
  BLOCK
}

within the context of a flowed presentation region, a (dtf/area-marker 'GLYPH) is not expressed, but is implied at
the boundary of each glyph code

4. dtf/character

The following slots are defined:

* ch, where (wide-character? ch) => #t

5. dtf/glyph

The following slots are defined:

* font index
* glyph index
* background color
* foreground color
* decorations
* x position (relative to some reference point, e.g., containing region's origin, containing block's origin,
  containing line's baseline origin, containing inline's baseline origin, prior glyph's origin, prior glyphs's
  origin plus escapement)
* y position (relative to some reference point, as with x position)
* x escapement
* y escapement
