# Test the Web Forward Meetup Kit

<h2 id="getting_started">Getting Started</h2>
This kit will help you host a Test the Web Forward meetup event, which is a smaller, shorter, simpler event than the [larger hackathon events][event-kit].  The information in this kit is presented with the assumption that you have experience hosting meetups, so this it focuses solely on content related to Test the Web Forward.

To get started, you should first familiarize yourself with Test the Web Forward, its goals and its history (if you aren't already). The best way to do this is to browse through the information here on [testthewebforward.org][home]. If you haven't ever been to an event, it may also be helpful to take a look at some of the [past event recaps][recaps]. This will give you an idea of the goals of the movement and will give you a feel for larger events. Keep in mind that any portion of a previous event's program can be extracted and presented in a smaller meetup format. For example, a some the instructional talks given at a past hackathons can be presented at a meetup to educate attendees on how to contribute on their own. Also, if meetup attendees are already knowledgeable on W3C test writing, a meetup could take the form of a hacking session.

Once you have yourself familiarized with Test the Web Forward and how relates to your community, you can begin your meetup planning by considering the following:

* When and where will you hold your meetup?
* What is the [goal][meetup-topics] of your meetup? 
* What [topic(s)][meetup-topics] would you like to cover?
* Who is your target community?
* Who are possible speakers?

Also, subscribe to the general [pubic-testtwf][public-testtwf] mailing list so that you will always stay updated on past and future events.

## Communication
