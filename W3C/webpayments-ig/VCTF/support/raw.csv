Pleas reconsider the word 'rich' in goal three. In my interpretation, from a user perspective the verifiable claim should not be 'rich' but 'just enough' to prove what needs to be proven. E.g. prove of age over 18 to by wine, the claim doesn't need to provide age, name, gender, whatever, but only the hash/prove (not to be manipulated) of 'over 18'. I believe it should be 'appropriate' or 'tailor made' for the purpose it serves."

KYC is not even a use case, its barely mentioned in the use cases as a scenario. Financial Services is an after thought. Additionally, verifiable claims shouldnt be another ""schema"". It should be child schema's within other schema's such that the VC data structures are consistent across many schema's (VC data model within other data model's). If we must ""exchange"" VC it must be in-band with the existing information system formats (such as ISO 20022).
