## Previous Action Items ##
  * Markus and Matt to start integrating API into specs with help from Kevin@apple
  * Markus ping Peter about script security warning prose
  * group to settle quickly on navhide, else this issue will be deferred to a later revision
  * Apple, Sony and RS vendors provide answer to whether 4b would work for them

## Timeline and Issue resolution status ##
  * Wednesday 4th of May: WG internal "candidate"
  * 4th - 16th May: proofreading/polishing
  * 16 or 17th May: submission

  * remaning _major_ issues dealt with on calls and list
  * _minor_ issues that still need discussion: chairs will post 1 proposed solution; 72 hour window for objections/modification suggestions.


## Scripting Issues ##
_Status update - API spec integration_

Spec modifications:

  * All Reading Systems that enable scripting [must implement](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#confreq-rs-scripted-readingsystem-object) the [the epubReadingSystem object](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#app-epubReadingSystem).
  * RS that enables scripting [\*must\* support/enable container-contained scripting](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#confreq-rs-scripted-support). The `spine-scripting` feature indicates if spine-level scripting is supported/enabled.
  * The `dom-manipulation` and `layout-changes` features [are always supported](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#confreq-rs-scripted-readingsystem-object) in container-constrained contexts.
  * The [definition of spine-level scripting](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-scripted-content-intro) has been modified to indicate that access to the DOM is allowed, but a Reading System indicates its support for modifications via the `dom-manipulation` feature.


## Linking Scheme Registry ##
  * BillM/Markus: proposal for registry setup
    * a linking scheme is a standalone IDPF spec;
      * it goes through the standard IDPF approval process,
      * it is subject to IP review
      * it uses the same versioning approach/guidelines as the other specs
      * and so on.
      * thus, EPUB3 (and future) specs can normatively reference entries in the registry
    * the registry is broad enough in scope to eventually contain at least one scheme for the "left-hand-side" (ie Publication identifier as opposed to fragment identifier)
    * IDPF will define an incubation process for new schemes (will work on this after 3.0 is out)
    * the registry will live outside the /30/ branch at idpf.org (e.g. http://www.idpf.org/epub/linking/)
    * this registry is just an index, so the actual CFI spec would live at something like http://www.idpf.org/epub/linking/cfi/

_The intent is to submit CFI to the board along with the EPUB3 spec in May. Note that there is one [implementation](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2Fsamples%2Fcfi)_

## CFI ##
  * status, further edits? / reviews ([work on updating CFI is ongoing here](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1gPMYtx4rsojqYDHWsfTJCtlfOpNQrg3tFH98htPQcJc))
  * 3.0RS requirement to support them?
  * are we clear on usage contexts?

## navhide ##
_Last remaining nav issue ([Issue 84](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=84)). If not settled on this call, deferred._
  * as suggested on prev call: can we use @hidden after all?
    * would we or would we not be skewing semantics / trigger undesired UA behaviors? [the hidden attribute definition](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-hidden-attribute)
    * since not tristate, does not allow expression of rendering intent in non-browser UI widgets, but we can probably live with that

## Video Codecs ##
_Progress on reports from Sony, Apple (and other RS vendors who have not expressed position yet) re support for [4B](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/CodecsRevisited#Option_#5:_"Ride_two_horses_for_real,"_require_Reading) as a solution?_

### Next call ###
