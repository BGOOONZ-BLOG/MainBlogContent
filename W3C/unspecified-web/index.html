        Parts of the Web stack are supported by browsers but not specified by standards. Needless to
        say, this hurts interoperability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to gather pieces of the Web stack that developers know can be
        useful but that aren't specified in an interoperable manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features that are eligible should be supported by more than one browser, even if perhaps
        differently between browsers. If you feel that a given browser sports a particularly
        important yet unspecified feature but is the only implementation for it feel free to make
        the case for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that this is <strong>not</strong> a document in which to list features you would
        <em>like</em> to see on the Web but aren't available in any implementation. For that, we
        recommend that you discuss the matter in
        <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discussion is open to all. If you would like to add some content, please make a 
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/unspecified-web/">pull requests</a> (just follow the way in
        which the rest of the HTML is structured). If you are unsure, or just want to signal a
        problem, just <a href="https://github.com/w3c/unspecified-web/issues">file an issue</a>.

      <h2>Markup</h2>
      <p>
        This section is for unspecified features to do with HTML, SVG, or MathML as languages.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        This section is for unspecified features to do with styling.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>APIs</h2>
      <p>
        This section is for unspecified features to do with APIs and scripting in general.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2><code>window.find()</code></h2>
        <p>
          This method finds a string in the DOM in the same way that the browser’s find
          functionality does. Its design is somewhat horrible but it is used by actual libraries and
          code in the wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is some <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/find">documentation</a> on
          MDN, as well as an <a
          href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=672395">interesting bug</a> on the
          topic. IE has it as <a
          href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536422.aspx"><code>findText()</code></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be specified sufficiently to be interoperable and work with existing content.</li>
          <li>
            Be complemented with a more modern API able to find <code>Range</code>s based on a
            search string.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2><code>console</code></h2>
        <p>
          The <code>console</code> object is universally supported but is not specified.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case has been made before that this is a developer-oriented feature that has no direct
          effect for most end users, and can thus go unspecified. It is safe to say that developers
          might not necessarily agree that it is wonderful for a content-exposed feature to lack
          interoperability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2><code>File Save As</code></h2>
        <p>
          This <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2015JanMar/0923.html">issue</a> was raised by Florian Bösch in the p-w mailing list recently. The following discussion indicated that these APIs have been implemented or will be implemented by the vendors but haven't got carefully designed yet.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Asynchronously write a large file (FileSaver & co.);</li>
          <li>Right click save-as;</li>
          <li>Overwrite (simple save).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These APIs should be clarified in the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/filesystem-api/Overview.html">FileSystem API</a> if possible.</p>

      <h2>Graphics</h2>
      <p>
        This section is for unspecified features to do with (primarily raster) graphics.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Cursor formats</h2>
        <p>The formats widely implemented for custom cursors (Microsoft .cur format, the related .ico and .ani) are only documented by a 1995 MSDN article and some blog posts.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h2>Animated PNG</h2>
      <p>The animated PNG proposal was rejected by the PNG development group and never became part
      of the official specification. It is however implemented in some browsers, and is useful.
      The tooling situation has also improved. Regularising the standards status would be a benefit.
      </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>
        This section is for unspecified features that fit nowhere else.
