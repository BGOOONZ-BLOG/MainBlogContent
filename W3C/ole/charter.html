      <h1 id="title">Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression  Working Group Charter (Draft)</h1>
        <p>The Web has provided the community with standardized mechanisms for numerous content-management services: publishing, distribution, consumption, describing, and sharing. However, the key area of permissions, obligations and licensing has not been addressed in Web standards to date. Content licenses, rights statements, permissions and obligations express the terms of usage for content. With a standard vocabulary, content owners can express terms and processing systems can determine what permissions and other terms are associated with a given resource or collection of resources.</p>
<p>A permissions and obligations expression system should provide a flexible and interoperable information model that supports transparent and innovative (re)use of digital content across all sectors and communities. The underlying model should support the business models of open, educational, government, and commercial communities through profiles that align with their specific requirements whilst retaining a common semantic layer for wider interoperability. The system should not, however, be the basis of legal compliance or enforcement mechanisms.</p>

<p>A permissions and obligations expression language is composed of detailed terms that are both machine-processable and expressible in a form for human-consumption. Allowable actions, constraints, and requirements are expressed at a level enabling complex and business-specific expressions to be created from a vocabulary with specific semantics. This accommodates a broad range of situations and addresses a different business/user need than systems such as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> that provide generic sharing licenses.</p>

      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group</a> is to define a semantic data model for expressing permissions and obligations statements for digital content, and to define the technical elements to make it deployable across browsers and content systems.</p>

  </div>
<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The semantic information model, vocabulary, and serializations will start from the ODRL specifications, developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a>. The ODRL work began 15 years ago and has been evolving the specification to meet industry and community requirements with wide scale adoption. Over the past few years the group transformed into the W3C ODRL Community Group and has created five updated Version 2.1 specifications (an information model, vocabulary, XML encoding, JSON encoding, and ontology). The current ODRL specifications are deployed as profiles by business sectors, for example the <a href="http://dev.iptc.org/RightsML-Work-in-Progress">IPTC has adopted ODRL</a> for licensing online news articles.</p>

<p>The Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression  Working Group will take into account additional needs of the wider community including commercial and non-commercial publishers, consumers and re-users of human readable content and machine readable data. In addition, implementation feedback from related languages and initiatives will be considered in the final deliverables. For example, <a href="http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/"><abbr title="Open Data Rights Statements">ODRS</abbr></a> and <a href="https://www.useplus.com/">PLUS photo licensing</a>.</p>

<p>In order to address the needs of atomic rights and obligations expressions, this Working Group will produce deliverables that define an abstract information model that is then realized in a variety of mappings and serializations. This work will take the form of <a href="#deliverables">several specifications</a> as Recommendation Track documents and supporting Notes.</p>
</div>

      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="noscope">Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>The Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression  Working Group will <strong>not</strong> be considering:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>access control mechanisms;</li>
            <li>digital rights management;</li>
            <li>a rule language for combining statements (beyond simple set operations);</li>
            <li>enforcement mechanisms;</li>
            <li>legal jurisdiction issues.</li>
          </ul>
       </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
        <p>The titles of the deliverables are not final; the Working Group will have to decide on the final titles as well as the structures of the documents. The Working Group may also decide to merge some deliverables into one document or produce several documents that together constitute one of the deliverables.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Additional Use Cases and Requirements document (Note)</li>
          <li>A technology-neutral permissions and obligations information model (Recommendation)</li>
          <li>A definition of the formal semantics of the information model (Note)</li>
          <li>A vocabulary for machine-readable expression of permissions and obligations (Recommendation)</li>
          <li>Mapping of the model and terms in XML (Recommendation)</li>
          <li>Mapping of the model and terms in RDF/OWL (Recommendation)</li>
          <li>Mapping of the model and terms in JSON (Recommendation)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The working group will further consider publishing a Note describing a P &amp; O expression of Creative Commons licenses.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Inputs</h3>
         <p>The Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression  Working Group will use the following W3C ODRL Community Group specifications as the starting position:</p>
          <ul>
           <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/community/odrl/model/2.1/" class="none">ODRL Version 2.1 Information Model</a></li>
           <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/community/odrl/vocab/2.1/" class="none">ODRL Version 2.1 Common Vocabulary</a></li>
           <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/community/odrl/xml/2.1/" class="none">ODRL Version 2.1 XML Encoding</a></li>
           <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/community/odrl/json/2.1/" class="none">ODRL Version 2.1 JSON Encoding</a></li>
           <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/ODRL21" class="none">ODRL Version 2.1 Ontology</a></li>
          </ul>
        <p>Other similar models, languages, and terms will also be considered by the Working Group based on an analysis of additional Use Cases and Requirements that the group will collect.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
       <h3 id="secAndPriv">Security and Privacy Considerations</h3>
        <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
      </div>


      <div>
        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>To advance the encoding specifications to Proposed Recommendation, evidence will be gathered of independent implementations of permissions &amp; obligations expression systems (at least two per mapping).</p>

      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
      <p>To be successful, the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression  Working Group is expected to begin with 20 or more active participants and to sustain sufficient numbers to complete the multiple deliverables. To get the most out of this work, participants should expect to devote several hours a week; for budgeting purposes, we recommend at least half a day a week. For chairs and document editors the commitment will be higher, say, 1-2 days a week. Participants who follow the work less closely should be aware that if they miss decisions through inattention, further discussion of those issues may be ruled out of order. However, most participants follow some areas of discussion more closely than others, and the time needed to stay current therefore varies from week to week. The Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for each specification.</p>

      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.</p>
      <p>A formal vote should allow for remote asynchronous participation—using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques. Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is to be considered provisional until 5 working days after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the group's mailing list. </p>
