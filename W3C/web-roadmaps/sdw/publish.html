      <h1>Publish spatial data</h1>
      <p>There are standard patterns and solutions which, when followed, allow one to publish spatial data on the web in a manner that makes use of the full potential of the Web as a data sharing platform. Most of these best practices apply to any data, some are specifically for spatial data, statistical data, dataset descriptions or other types of data. Publishing data in this manner improves discoverability, accessibility and interoperability of spatial data.</p>

        <!-- general guidelines-->
        <p data-feature="Data on the web guidelines">The <a data-featureid="dwbp">Data on the Web Best Practice (DWBP)</a> provide a set of recommendations that are applicable to the publication of all types of data on the Web. Those best practices cover aspects including data formats, data access, data identifiers, metadata, licensing and provenance. </p>
        <p data-feature="Spatial data on the web guidelines">The <a data-featureid="sdw-bp">Spatial data on the Web Best Practice</a> extends the DWBP and gives best practices related to the publication of spatial data on the Web; the use of Web technologies as they may be applied to location. The best practices presented here are intended for practitioners, including Web developers and geospatial experts, and are compiled based on evidence of real-world application. These best practices suggest a significant change of emphasis from traditional Spatial Data Infrastructures by adopting an approach based on general Web standards. </p>
        <!-- to describe a spatial dataset -->
        <p data-feature="Dataset description">When publishing datasets, it is a good idea to publish a dataset description along with it. In the eGovernment sector, <a data-featureid="vocab-dcat">DCAT vocabulary</a> is a standard for dataset metadata publication and harvesting implemented by data portals.</p>
        <!--to query using spatial operators-->
        <p data-feature="Spatial query">To query data using spatial operators, the OGC standard <a data-featureid="geosparql">GeoSPARQL</a> offers a query language for RDF data, including the following set of operators: <em>equal, disjoint, touches, within, overlaps, crosses, intersects, contains</em>.To use spatial and temporal information with OpenSearch, a collection of simple formats to share search results, the OGC standard <a data-featureid="opensearchgeo">OpenSearch Geo and Time Extensions</a> is available.</p>
        <p data-feature="3D tiling">To visualize heterogeneous 3D geospatial data on the Web in an efficient way, <a data-featureid="i3s">Indexed 3D Scene Layers</a> (i3S) can be used. In i3S, 3D data can be partitioned into arbitrarily large containers called "Scene layers". Each layer has its own behavior and properties. i3S is based on REST, JSON and other Web standards.</p>

        <!-- guidelines for stats-->
        <p data-feature="Statistics guidelines">The <a data-featureid="stats-bp">Statistical Data on the Web Best Practices</a> is a Note currently being written by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/sdwig/">Spatial data on the Web interest group</a> (SDWIG). Like the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices, this Note will be a specialization of the more general Data on the Web Best Practices Recommendation, offering guidance on sharing statistical data. The aim of the work is to provide guidance on how statistical data can be made to work more effectively as part of the overall Web of Data. While not restricted to the geospatial aspects of statistical data, the relation between statistical and spatial considerations will be given particular emphasis.</p>
        <!-- to describe a spatial dataset -->
        <p data-feature="Dataset description"><a data-featureid="vocab-dcat-2">DCAT Revised addition</a> is currently under development by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Main_Page">Dataset exchange working group</a> (DXWG) and will be an update and expansion of the previous DCAT. </p>
        <!-- to provide access-->
        <p data-feature="Access to spatial things">A new version of the OGC standard <a data-featureid="wfs3">Web Feature Service (WFS)</a> is being developed at the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC) for querying geospatial information on the web. It is a complete rewrite of previous versions, focusing on a simple RESTful core specified as reusable OpenAPI components with responses in JSON and HTML.</p>
        <p data-feature="3D tiling">For publishing, partitioning and streaming massive heterogeneous 3-dimensional geospatial datasets, <a data-featureid="3dtiles">Cesium 3DTiles</a> is available. It is currently in the process of becoming an OGC community standard.</p>

        <h2>Exploratory work</h2>
        <!-- guidelines for sensor data -->
        <p data-feature="SSN guidelines">Although work has not started, it is the intention of the SDWIG to produce an SSN Primer which will explain how best to use the SOSA and SSN vocabularies.</p>
        <p data-feature="Sensor and observations guidelines">Although work has not started, the SDWIG may produce a Sensors and observations Note, giving an overview of the standards landscape related to sensors and observations (such as the Generic Sensor API family, the WoT family, SSN, SensorThings API etc) that explains the scope of each of these standards, their application to practical use cases and mechanisms by which they may be combined.</p>
        <!-- to describe a spatial dataset -->
        <p data-feature="Spatial dataset description">Because DCAT is lacking in possibilities for describing some specific characteristics spatial datasets, an application profile for spatial data, <a data-featureid="geodcat-ap">GeoDCAT-AP</a> has been developed in the framework of ISA Programme of the European Union, with the primary purpose of enabling the sharing of spatial metadata across domains and catalogue platforms. It defines RDF bindings covering metadata standards from the geospatial domain, enabling the harmonized RDF representation of existing spatial metadata. </p>
        <!-- to present a view -->
        <p data-feature="Present a view"><a data-featureid="mapml">Map Markup Language</a> (MapML) is an HTML- and DOM-compatible hypertext format for declaratively representing 2D map layers with embedded or linked tile, image and vector features, designed after the architectural style of the Web, by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#pave-the-cowpaths">paving the cowpaths</a> of Web mapping. Map layers may be used individually or stacked using custom elements or other standard Web technologies (browsers), to compose a complete map. MapML uses links and forms to integrate standard OGC technologies into the fabric of the Web 'without programming'.</p>
        <!-- partitioning data for the web-->
        <p data-feature="Geospatial data partitioning"><em>Vector tiling</em> is a name for solutions where geographic data is packaged into pre-defined roughly-square shaped tiles for transfer over the web. There are several existing solutions, none yet standardized. The most well known specification is <a data-featureid="mapbox-vector-tiles">Mapbox Vector Tiles</a>.</p>
