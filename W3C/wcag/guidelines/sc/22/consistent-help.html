    <h4>Consistent Help</h4>
    
    <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
	<p class="change">New</p>
    
    <p>If a <a>web page</a> contains any of the following help mechanisms, and those mechanisms are repeated on multiple web pages within a <a>set of web pages</a>, they occur in the same relative order to other page content, unless a change is initiated by the user:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Human contact details;</li>
        <li>Human contact mechanism;</li>
        <li>Self-help option;</li>
        <li>A fully automated contact mechanism.</li>
    </ul>

  <p class="note">Access to help mechanisms may be provided directly on the page, or may be provided via a direct link to a different page containing the information.</p>
  <p class="note">For this SC, the same relative order can be thought of as how the content is ordered when the page is serialized. The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across pages for the same page variation (e.g., CSS break-point). The user can cause a change, for example zoom or change orientation, which may trigger a different page variation.</p>
