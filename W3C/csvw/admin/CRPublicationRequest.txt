[Version sent to the Webmaster, 10 jul]

Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of four CSVW WG documents as Candidate Recommendations. The publication date is the 16th of July, 2015. The transition request for CR has been issued in:

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2015JulSep/0006.html

the Director's approval is in:

	https://www.w3.org/2015/07/10-csvw-cr-minutes.html

As agreed previously, as an exceptional measure I would appreciate if you could copy the files from github to /TR/2015. The snapshot directories are prepared as a full copy of what should be published, including auxilliary files.

Please, do not publish these documents *before* the 16th; there has to be a one-week gap between the transition request and the actual publication.

The documents are already in place and pass the pubrules' checker.

For second document the namespace checker also reports errors on the following:

http://schema.org/{_name} (1 occurrence)
-> 405 (Method Not Allowed)
http://www.geonames.org/ontology{#_name} (1 occurrence)
-> 404 (Not Found)
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-type (2 occurrences)
-> 404 (NOT FOUND)

All three are examples in the text (the first two for so called URI templates, the third for a generic media type URI-s), none of these are active links in the text. As a consequence, these are not bugs, and the report can be safely ignored.

Coralie & Maria: I will send a separate mail to you and comm team for the AC announcement and the HPN news.

Thanks!

Ivan
