      group</a>, particularly that working group's requirements document:
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-hodges-websec-framework-reqs">draft-hodges-websec-framework-reqs</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This document defines Content Security Policy, a mechanism web
      applications can use to mitigate a broad class of content injection
      vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). Content Security
      Policy is a declarative policy that lets the authors (or server
      administrators) of a web application inform the client from where the
      application expects to load resources.</p>

      <p>To mitigate XSS, for example, a web application can declare from where
      it expects to load scripts, allowing the client to detect and block
      malicious scripts injected into the application by an attacker.</p>

      <p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is not intended as a first line of
      defense against content injection vulnerabilities. Instead, CSP is best
      used as defense-in-depth, to reduce the harm caused by content injection
      attacks.</p>

      <p>There is often a non-trivial amount of work required to apply CSP to
      an existing web application. To reap the greatest benefit, authors will
      need to move all inline script and style out-of-line, for example into
      external scripts, because the user agent cannot determine whether an
      inline script was injected by an attacker.</p>

      <p>To take advantage of CSP, a web application opts into using CSP by
      supplying a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> HTTP header Such
      policies apply the current resource representation only. To supply a
      policy for an entire site, the server needs to supply a policy with each
      resource representation.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
      "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
      steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST",
      "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>

      <p>A <dfn>conformant user agent</dfn> MUST implement all the
      requirements listed in this specification that are applicable to
      user-agents, and MAY implement those marked as "(Optional)".

      <p>A <dfn>conformant server</dfn> MUST implement all the requirements
      listed in this specification that are applicable to servers.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Key Concepts and Terminology</h3>

        <p>This section defines several terms used throughout the document.</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>security policy</dfn>, or
        simply <dfn>policy</dfn>, for the purposes of this
        specification refers to either:
          <ol>
            <li>a set of security preferences for restrictions within which the
            content can operate, or</li>
            <li>a fragment of text that codifies these preferences.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>The security policies defined by this document are applied by a
        user agent on a <em>per-resource representation basis</em>.
        Specifically, when a user agent receives a policy along with the
        representation of a given resource, that policy applies to <em>that
        resource representation only</em>. This document often refers to
        that resource representation as the <dfn>protected resource</dfn>.

        <p>A server transmits its security policy for a particular protected
        resource as a collection of <dfn>directives</dfn>, such as
        <code>default-src 'self'</code>, each of which declares a specific set
        of restrictions for that resource as instantiated by the user agent.
        More details are provided in the <a href="#directives">directives</a>
        section.</p>

        <p>A directive consists of a <dfn>directive name</dfn>, which
        indicates the privileges controlled by the directive, and a
        <dfn>directive value</dfn>, which specifies the restrictions the
        policy imposes on those privileges.</p>

        <p>The term <dfn id="origin">origin</dfn> is defined in the Origin specification. [[!RFC6454]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>URI</dfn> is defined in the URI specification.  [[!URI]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>resource representation</dfn> is defined in the HTTP 1.1 specification.  [[!HTTP11]]</p>

        <p>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;track&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>
        and <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements are defined in the HTML5 specification. [[!HTML5]]</p>

        <p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#plugin">plugin</a> is defined
        in the HTML5 specification. [[!HTML5]]</p> 

        <p>The <code>@font-face</code> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rule is defined in the
        CSS Fonts Module Level 3 specification. [[!CSS3FONT]]</p>

        <p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is defined in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>
        specification. [[!XMLHTTPREQUEST]]</p>

        <p>The <code>WebSocket</code> object is defined in the <code>WebSocket</code>
        specification. [[!WEBSOCKETS]]</p>

        <p>The <code>EventSource</code> object is defined in the <code>EventSource</code>
        specification. [[!EVENTSOURCE]]</p>

        <p>The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation used in this
        document is specified in RFC 5234. [[!ABNF]]</p>

        <p>This document also uses the ABNF extension "#rule" as defined in HTTP 1.1. [[!HTTP11]]</p>

        <p>The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
        [<em><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1">ABNF Appendix B.1</a></em>]:
        <code>ALPHA</code> (letters), <code>DIGIT</code> (decimal
        0-9), <code>WSP</code> (white space) and <code>VCHAR</code> (printing
        characters).</p>

      <h2>Framework</h2>

      <p>This section defines the general framework for content security
      policies, including the delivery mechanisms and general syntax for
      policies. The next section contains the details of the specific
      directives introduced in this specification.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Policy Delivery</h3>

        <p>The server delivers the policy to the user agent via an HTTP
        response header.</p>

        <section>
          <h4><code>Content-Security-Policy</code> Header Field</h4>

          <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field is the
          preferred mechanism for delivering a CSP policy.</p>

<pre>
"Content-Security-Policy:" 1#policy
</pre>

          <p>A server MAY send more than one HTTP header field named
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> with a given resource
          representation.</p>

          <p>A server MAY send different <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
          header field values with different representations of the same
          resource or with different resources.</p>

          <p>Upon receiving an HTTP response containing at least one
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field, the user agent
          MUST <a href="#enforce">enforce</a> each of the policies contained
          in each such header field.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4><code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> Header Field</h4>

          <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field
          lets servers experiment with policies by monitoring (rather than
          enforcing) a policy.</p>

<pre>
"Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only:" 1#policy
</pre>

          <p>For example, a server operators might wish to develop their
          security policy iteratively. The operators can deploy a report-only
          policy based on their best estimate of how their site behaves. If
          their site violates this policy, instead of breaking the site, the
          user agent will send violation reports to a URI specified in the
          policy. Once a site has confidence that the policy is appropriate,
          they start enforcing the policy using the
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field.</p>

          <p>A server MAY send more than one HTTP header field named
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> with a given
          resource representation.<p>

          <p>A server MAY send different
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field values
          with different representations of the same resource or with different
          resources.</p>

          <p>Upon receiving an HTTP response containing at least one
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field, the
          user agent MUST <a href="#monitor">monitor</a> each of the policies
          contained in each such header field.</p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Syntax and Algorithms</h3>

        <section>
          <h4>Policies</h4>

          <p>A CSP <dfn>policy</dfn> consists of a U+003B SEMICOLON
          (<code>;</code>) delimited list of directives:</p>

<pre>
policy            = [ directive *( ";" [ directive ] ) ]
</pre>

          <p>Each <dfn>directive</dfn> consists of a <var>directive-name</var>
          and (optionally) a <var>directive-value</var>:</p>

<pre>
directive         = *WSP [ directive-name [ WSP directive-value ] ]
directive-name    = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )
directive-value   = *( WSP / &lt;VCHAR except ";" and ","&gt; )
</pre>

          <section>
            <h5>Parsing</h5>

            <p>To <dfn id="parse-a-csp-policy">parse a CSP policy</dfn>
            <var>policy</var>, the user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to
            the following:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Let the <var>set of directives</var> be the empty set.</li>

              <li>For each non-empty token returned by <a

              splitting</a> the string <var>policy</var> on the character U+003B
              SEMICOLON (<code>;</code>):

                  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-microsyntaxes.html#skip-whitespace">Skip whitespace</a>.</li>

                  collected characters are the <var>directive name</var>.</li>

                  <li>If there are characters remaining in <var>token</var>,
                  skip ahead exactly one character (which must be a <a

                  character</a>).</li>

                  <li>The remaining characters in <var>token</var> (if any) are
                  the <var>directive value</var>.</li>

                  <li>If the <var>set of directives</var> already contains a
                  directive with name <var>directive name</var>, ignore this
                  instance of the directive and continue to the next token.</li>

              <li>Return the <var>set of directives</var>.
            </ol>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Source List</h4>

          <p>Many CSP directives use a value consisting of a <dfn>source
          list</dfn>.</p>

          <p>Each <dfn>source expression</dfn> in the source list represents a
          location from which content of the specified type can be retrieved.
          For example, the source expression <code>'self'</code> represents
          the set of URIs which are in the same <a href="#origin">origin</a> as the protected
          resource and the source expression <code>'unsafe-inline'</code>
          represents content supplied inline in the resource itself.</p>

<pre>
source-list       = *WSP [ source-expression *( 1*WSP source-expression ) *WSP ]
                  / *WSP "'none'" *WSP
source-expression = scheme-source / host-source / keyword-source
scheme-source     = scheme ":"
host-source       = [ scheme "://" ] host [ port ]
ext-host-source   = host-source "/" *( &lt;VCHAR except ";" and ","&gt; )
                  ; ext-host-source is reserved for future use.
keyword-source    = "'self'" / "'unsafe-inline'" / "'unsafe-eval'"
scheme            = &lt;scheme production from RFC 3986&gt;
host              = "*" / [ "*." ] 1*host-char *( "." 1*host-char )
host-char         = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-"
port              = ":" ( 1*DIGIT / "*" )
</pre>

            <p>To <dfn id="parse-a-source-list">parse a source list</dfn>
            <var>source list</var>, the user agent MUST use an algorithm
            equivalent to the following:</p>

              <li>If <var>source list</var> (with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-microsyntaxes.html#strip-leading-and-trailing-whitespace">leading
              and trailing whitespace stripped</a>) is a case insensitive match
              for the string <code>'none'</code> (including the quotation
              marks), return the empty set.</li>

              <li>Let the <var>set of source expressions</var> be the empty set.</li>

              grammar for <code>source-expression</code> or
              <code>ext-host-source</code>, add the token to the <var>set of
              source expressions</var>.</li>

              <li>Return the <var>set of source expressions</var>.</li>

            <h5>Matching</h5>

            <p>To check whether a URI <dfn
            id="matches-a-source-expression">matches a source expression</dfn>,
            the user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the

              <li>If the source expression a consists of a single U+002A ASTERISK character

                <ol>
                  <li>If the URI's scheme is a case-insensitive match for the
                  source expression's <code>scheme</code>, return <em>does
                  match</em>.</li>

                  <li>Otherwise, return <em>does not match</em>.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>If the source expression matches the grammar for
              <code>host-source</code> or <code>ext-host-source</code>:
                <ol>
                  <li>If the URI does not contain a host, then return <em>does

        <h3>Processing Model</h3>

        <p>To <dfn id="enforce">enforce</dfn> a CSP policy, the user agent MUST
        <a href="#parse-a-csp-policy">parse the policy</a> and enforce each of
        the directives contained in the policy, where the specific
        requirements for enforcing each directive are defined separately for
        each directive (See <a href="#sec-directives">Directives</a>,
        below).</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, enforcing a directive prevents the protected
        resource from performing certain actions, such as loading scripts from
        URIs other than those indicated in a source list. These restrictions
        make it more difficult for an attacker to abuse an injection
        vulnerability in the resource because the attacker will be unable to
        usurp the resource's privileges that have been restricted in this
        way.</p>

        <p>Enforcing a CSP policy SHOULD NOT interfere with the operation of
        user-supplied scripts such as third-party user-agent add-ons and
        JavaScript bookmarklets.</p>

        <p>To <dfn id="monitor">monitor</dfn> a CSP policy, the user agent MUST
        <a href="#parse-a-csp-policy">parse the policy</a> and monitor each of
        the directives contained in the policy.</p>

        <p>Monitoring a directive does not prevent the protected resource from
        undertaking any actions. Instead, any actions that would have been
        prevented by the directives are instead reported to the developer of
        the web application. Monitoring a CSP policy is useful for testing
        whether enforcing the policy will cause the web application to
        malfunction.</p>

        <p>A server MAY cause user agents to monitor one policy while enforcing
        another policy by returning both <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
        and <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header fields.
        For example, if a server operator is using one policy but wishes to
        experiment with a stricter policy, the server operator can monitor
        the stricter policy while enforcing the original policy. Once the
        server operator is satisfied that the stricter policy does not break
        the web application, the server operator can start enforcing the
        stricter policy.</p>

        <p>If the user agent monitors or enforces a CSP policy that does not
        contain any directives, the user agent SHOULD report a warning message
        in the developer console.</p>

        <p>If the user agent monitors or enforces a CSP policy that contains
        an unrecognized directive, the user agent SHOULD report a warning
        message in the developer console indicating the name of the
        unrecognized directive.</p>

        <p>Whenever a user agent <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#run-a-worker">runs a worker</a>:
        [[!WEBWORKERS]]</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the user agent is enforcing a CSP policy for the <var>owner
          document</var>, the user agent MUST enforce the CSP policy for the
          worker.</li>

          <li>If the user agent is monitoring a CSP policy for the <var>owner
          document</var>, the user agent MUST monitor the CSP policy for the
          worker.</li>

      <h2 id="sec-directives">Directives</h2>

      <p>This section describes the content security policy directives
      introduced in this specification.</p>

      <p>In order to protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), web
      application authors SHOULD include
      <ul>
        <li>both the <code>script-src</code> and <code>object-src</code>
        directives, or</li>

        <li>include a <code>default-src</code> directive, which covers both
        scripts and plugins.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In either case, authors SHOULD NOT include
      <code>'unsafe-inline'</code> in their CSP policies if they wish to
      protect themselves against XSS.</p>

      <section>
        <h3><code>default-src</code></h3>

        <p>The <code>default-src</code> directive sets a default source list
        for a number of directives. The syntax for the name and value of the
        directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "default-src"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>Let the <var>default sources</var> be the result of <a
        href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the directive's value as a
        source list</a>.</p>

        <p>To enforce the <code>default-src</code> directive, the user agent
        MUST enforce the following directives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>script-src</li>
          <li>object-src</li>
          <li>style-src</li>
          <li>img-src</li>
          <li>media-src</li>
          <li>frame-src</li>
          <li>font-src</li>
          <li>connect-src</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If not specified explicitly in the policy, the directives listed
        above will use the <var>default sources</var>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3><code>script-src</code></h3>

        <p>The <code>script-src</code> directive restricts which scripts the
        protected resource can execute. The directive also controls other
        resources, such as XSLT style sheets [[!XSLT]], which can cause the
        user agent to execute script. The syntax for the name and value of
        the directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "script-src"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>If the policy contains an explicit <code>script-src</code>, let the
        <var>allowed script sources</var> be the result of <a
        href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the directive's value as a source
        list</a>. Otherwise, let the <var>allowed script sources</var> be the
        <var>default sources</var></p>

        <p>If <code>'unsafe-inline'</code> is <strong>not</strong> in
        <var>allowed script sources</var>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever the user agent would execute an inline script (either
          from a <code>script</code> element or from an inline event handler),
          instead the user agent MUST NOT execute script.</li>

          <li>Whenever the user agent would execute script contained in a
          <code>javascript</code> URI, instead the user agent MUST NOT execute
          the script. (The user agent SHOULD execute script contained in
          "bookmarklets" even when enforcing this restriction.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If <code>'unsafe-eval'</code> is <strong>not</strong> in
        <var>allowed script sources</var>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of evaluating their arguments, both operator
          <code>eval</code> and function <code>eval</code>
          MUST throw a security exception. [[!ECMA-262]]</li>

          <li>When called as a constructor, the function <code>Function</code>
          MUST throw a security exception. [[!ECMA-262]]</li>

          <li>When called with a first argument that is non-callable (e.g.,
          not a function), the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/timers.html#dom-windowtimers-settimeout"><code>setTimeout</code></a>
          function MUST return zero without creating a timer.</li>

          <li>When called with a first argument that is non-callable (e.g.,
          not a function), the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/timers.html#dom-windowtimers-setinterval"><code>setInterval</code></a>
          function MUST return zero without creating a timer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The term <dfn>callable</dfn> refers to an object whose interface
        has one or more <dfn>callers</dfn> as defined in the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-WebIDL-20101021/#idl-callers">Web
        IDL</a> specification [[!WEBIDL]].</p>

        <p>Whenever the user agent <a

        a URI (including when following redirects) in the course of one of the
        following activities, if the URI does not <a
        href="#matches-a-source-list">match the <var>allowed script
        sources</var></a>, the user agent MUST act as if it had received an empty

        <ul>

          constructors.</li>

          <li>Requesting an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
          (XSLT) [[!XSLT]], such as when processing the
          <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code> processing directive in an XML
          document [[!XML11]], the <code>href</code> attributes on
          <code>&lt;xsl:include&gt;</code> element, or the <code>href</code>
          attributes on <code>&lt;xsl:import&gt;</code> element.</li>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>object-src</code></h3>

        <p>The <code>object-src</code> directive restricts from where the
        protected resource can load plugins. The syntax for the name and value
        of the directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "object-src"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>If the policy contains an explicit <code>object-src</code>, let the
        <var>allowed object sources</var> be the result of <a
        href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the directive's value as a source
        list</a>. Otherwise, let the <var>allowed object sources</var> be the
        <var>default sources</var></p>

        <p>Whenever the user agent <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/fetching-resources.html#fetch">fetches</a>
        a URI (including when following redirects) in the course of one of the
        following activities, if the URI does not <a
        href="#matches-a-source-list">match the <var>allowed object
        sources</var></a>, the user agent MUST act as if it had received an empty
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.1">HTTP 400 response</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Requesting data for a plugin, such as when processing the
          <code>data</code> attribute of an <code>object</code> element, the
          <code>src</code> attribute of an <code>embed</code> elements, or the
          <code>code</code> or <code>archive</code> attributes of an
          <code>applet</code> element.</li>

          <li>Requesting data for display in a
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#nested-browsing-contexts">nested browsing context</a>
          in the protected resource created by an <code>object</code> or an

          <li>Navigating such a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#nested-browsing-contexts">nested browsing context</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is not required that the consumer of the element's data be a
        plugin in order for the <code>object-src</code> directive to be
        enforced.  Data for any <code>object</code>, <code>embed</code>,
        or <code>applet</code> element MUST match the <var>allowed object
        sources</var> in order to be fetched.  This is true even when the

        be restricted by one of the other <a href="#directives">directives</a>,
        such as an <code>object</code> element with a <code>text/html</code>
        MIME type.</p>

        <p>Whenever the user agent would load a plugin without an associated
        URI (e.g., because the <code>object</code> element lacked a
        <code>data</code> attribute), if the protected resource's URI does not
        <a href="#matches-a-source-list">match the <var>allowed object
        sources</var></a>, the user agent MUST NOT load the plugin.</p>

      <section>
        <h4><code>style-src</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>style-src</code> directive restricts which styles the
        user applies to the protected resource. The syntax for the name and
        value of the directive are described by the following ABNF
        grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "style-src"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>


        <p>If the policy contains an explicit <code>style-src</code>, let the
        <var>allowed style sources</var> be the result of <a
        href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the directive's value as a source
        list</a>. Otherwise, let the <var>allowed style sources</var> be the
        <var>default sources</var></p>

        <p>If <code>'unsafe-inline'</code> is <strong>not</strong> in
        <var>allowed style sources</var>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever the user agent would apply style from a
          <code>style</code> element, instead the user agent <code>MUST</code>
          ignore the style.</li>

          <li>Whenever the user agent would apply style from a
          <code>style</code> attribute, instead the user agent
          <code>MUST</code> ignore the style.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note: These restrictions on inline do not prevent the user agent
        from applying style from an external stylesheet (e.g., found via
        <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code>). The user agent is also
        not prevented from applying style from Cascading Style Sheets Object
        Model (CSSOM). [[!CSSOM]]</p>

        <p>Whenever the user agent <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/fetching-resources.html#fetch">fetches</a>
        a URI (including when following redirects) in the course of one of the
        following activities, if the URI does not <a
        href="#matches-a-source-list">match the <var>allowed style

          <code>stylesheet</code> or when processing the <code>@import</code>
          directive in a stylesheet.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note: The <code>style-src</code> directive does not restrict the
        use of XSLT. XSLT is restricted by the <code>script-src</code>
        directive because the security consequences of including an untrusted
        XSLT stylesheet are similar to those incurred by including an
        untrusted script.</p>

      <section>
        <h4><code>img-src</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>img-src</code> directive restricts from where the

      <h2>Examples</h2>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Sample Policy Definitions</h3>

        <p>This section provides some sample use cases and accompanying security policies.</p>

        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A server wishes to load resources only
        form its own origin:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'</pre>

        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> An auction site wishes to load images
        from any URI, plugin content from a list of trusted media providers
        (including a content distribution network), and scripts only from a
        server under its control hosting sanitized ECMAScript:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *;
                         object-src media1.example.com media2.example.com *.cdn.example.com;
                         script-src trustedscripts.example.com</pre>

        <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Online banking site wishes to ensure that all of the content
        in its pages is loaded over TLS to prevent attackers from eavesdropping on insecure content
        requests:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'</pre>

        <p>This policy allows inline content (such as inline <code>script</code> elements), use of
        <code>eval</code>, and loading resources over <code>https</code>.  Note: This policy does
        not provide any protection from cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

        <p><strong>Example 4:</strong> A social network wishes to ensure that all scripts are loaded
        from a specific path to prevent user-generated content from being interpreted as script:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src https://example.com/js/</pre>

        <p>Unfortunately, this use case is not supported in CSP 1.0. The user agent will ignore
        the path and act as if the policy contained a <code>script-src</code> directive with value
        <code>https://example.com</code>. A future version of CSP might begin enforcing these path
        restrictions, however.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Sample Violation Report</h3>

        <p>This section contains an example violation report the user agent
        might sent to a server when the protected resource violations a sample
        policy.</p>

        <p>In the following example, the user agent rendered a representation
        of the resource <code>http://example.org/page.html</code> with the
        following CSP policy:</p>

<pre>default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.org/csp-report.cgi</pre>

        <p>The protected resource loaded an image from
        <code>http://evil.example.com/image.png</code>, violating the
        policy.</p>

        <pre>{
  "csp-report": {
    "document-uri": "http://example.org/page.html",
    "referrer": "http://evil.example.com/haxor.html",
    "blocked-uri": "http://evil.example.com/image.png",
    "violated-directive": "default-src 'self'",
    "original-policy": "default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.org/csp-report.cgi"
  }

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) Parsing</h3>

        <p>The <code>style-src</code> directive restricts the locations from
        which the protected resource can load styles. However, if the user agent uses a
        lax CSS parsing algorithm, an attacker might be able to trick the user
        agent into accepting malicious "style sheets" hosted by an otherwise
        trustworthy origin.</p>

        <p>These attacks are similar to the <a
        href="http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/12/generic-cross-browser-cross-domain.html">CSS
        cross-origin data leakage</a> attack described by Chris Evans in 2009.
        User agents SHOULD defend against both attacks using the same
        mechanism: stricter CSS parsing rules for style sheets with improper
        MIME types.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Violation Reports</h3>

        <p>The violation reporting mechanism in this document has been
        designed to mitigate the risk that a malicious web site could use
        violation reports to probe the behavior of other servers. For example,
        consider a malicious web site that white lists <code>https://example.com</code>
        as a source of images. If the malicious site attempts to load
        <code>https://example.com/login</code> as an image, and the
        <code>example.com</code> server redirects to an identity provider (e.g.,
        <code>idenityprovider.example.net</code>), CSP will block the request.
        If violation reports contained the full blocked URL, the violation
        report might contain sensitive information contained in the redirected URI,
        such as session identifiers or purported identities. For this reason, the
        user agent includes only the origin of the blocked URI.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>

      <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header is an end-to-end
      header.  It is processed and enforced at the client and, therefore,
      SHOULD NOT be modified or removed by proxies or other intermediaries not
      in the same administrative domain as the resource.</p>

      <p>The originating administrative domain for a resource might wish to
      apply a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header outside of the
      immediate context of an application.  For example, a large organization
      might have many resources and applications managed by different
      individuals or teams but all subject to a uniform organizational
      standard. In such situations, a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
      header might be added or combined with an existing one at a network-edge
      security gateway device or web application firewall.  To enforce multiple
      policies, the administrator SHOULD combine the policy into a single header.
      An administrator might wish to use different combination algorithms
      depending on his or her intended semantics.</p>

      <p>One sensible policy combination algorithm is to start by allowing a
      default set of sources and then letting individual upstream resource
      owners expand the set of allowed sources by including additional origins.
      In this approach, the resultant policy is the union of all allowed
      origins in the input policies.</p>

      <p>Another sensible policy combination algorithm is to intersect the
      given policies.  This approach enforces that content comes from a certain
      whitelist of origins, for example, preventing developers from including
      third-party scripts or content in violation of organizational standards
      and practices.  In this approach, the combination algorithm forms the
      combined policy by removing disallowed hosts from the policies supplied
      by upstream resource owners.</p>

      <p>Interactions between the <code>default-src</code> and other directives
      SHOULD be given special consideration when combining policies.  If none
      of the policies contains a <code>default-src</code> directive, adding new
      src directives results in a more restrictive policy.  However, if one or
      more of the input policies contain a <code>default-src</code> directive,
      adding new src directives might result in a less restrictive policy, for
      example, if the more specific directive contains a more permissive set of
      allowed origins.</p>

      <p>Using a more restrictive policy than the input policy authored by the
      resource owner might prevent the resource from rendering or operating as
      intended.</p>
