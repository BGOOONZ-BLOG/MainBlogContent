<section id="scope" class="scope">
<h2>Scope</h2>
        <ul>
<li>Technical issues related to internationalization and universal access across the globe. The Working Group provides advice and assistance related to internationalization, encompassing work related to international, linguistic, cultural, and writing system variations affecting W3C technologies. This advice should be provided to W3C Working Groups as early as possible in the development of specifications. The Working Group also tracks developments outside the W3C which have a bearing on the international Web, such as Unicode, <abbr title="Internationalized Domain Names">IDN</abbr>/ICANN issues, language tag and IRI (Internationalised Resource Identifiers) developments at the IETF, JavaScript, etc.</li>
<li>Horizontal reviews and discussion of W3C technologies for internationalization issues, as these technologies develop. This encompasses a broad array of cultural, linguistic, technical and accessibility concerns. Review work may also include standards created by external standards bodies and organizations related to internationalization, if it is thought to be relevant to W3C technology. The Working Group maintains liaison relationships with these groups to ensure coordinated, consistent development of these standards.</li>
<li>Gathering requirements for linguistic support. The Working Group supports groups documenting typographic and other requirements for scripts and languages around the world, with a view to informing specification developers and browser/ebook implementers about what needs to be supported.</li>
<li>Outreach and inreach, in the forms of notes, articles, tutorials, presentations, tests and other resources to help specification writers, web masters, content authors, and others involved in developing and implementing the Web understand the issues involved and the techniques available with regard to supporting international use of Web technology.</li>
<li>Implementation support and guidance. The WG produces tests for international features of the Web Platform, and provides advice and support to browser/ebook implementers to assist in the adoption of those features.</li>
        </ul>
</section>

    <section id="deliverables">
        <h2>
          Deliverables
        </h2>
<p>The formal documents produced by the Working Group are guidelines, best practices, requirements, and the like. These are best published as Working Group Notes. </p>
<p>The Working Group will not produce Rec-track specifications, but will maintain the following W3C Recommendations, should any changes be necessary:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-its-20070403/">Version 1.0</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/">Version 2.0</a></dt>
              <dd>These specifications define data categories and their implementation as a set of elements and attributes. ITS 2 adds additional concepts that are designed to foster the automated creation and processing of multilingual Web content.</dd>
              <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/">Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0: Fundamentals</a> </dt>
              <dd>It provides authors of specifications, software developers, and content developers with a common reference for interoperable text manipulation on the World Wide Web</dd>
              <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby">Ruby Annotation</a></dt>
              <dd>"Ruby" are short runs of text alongside the base text, typically used in East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or to provide a short annotation. This specification defined an XHTML module  for   ruby markup.</dd>
            </dl>


<h3>Language enablement</h3>
<p>The WG will work with, coordinate, and publish documents for various task forces within the Internationalization Interest Group, which produce document layout and related requirements for the Web Platform and Electronic Book technologies. The aim is to produce documents similar to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Japanese Layout Requirements</a> and gap-analysis documents for a range of scripts and languages, and other sources of information for implementers and content developers. See a list of <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-drafts/nav/languagedev#reviews">currently available information</a>.</p>

<p>Currently this work is managed through 13 repositories, typically each focused on a group of languages, where experts can discuss issues and requirements for support of their language or writing system on the Web. These repositories currently contain 28 gap-analysis documents (some of which cover multiple languages), from which 100 gaps have been identified for the pipeline dashboard which will help us determine and prioritise what needs attention. During the upcoming charter, the Working Group will guide this work forward, creating new repositories and gap analysis documents as needed to accomodate additional languages as issues arise and experts are available.</p>

<h3>Developer support</h3>
<p>Horizontal review of specifications of other W3C Working Groups for issues related to
internationalization, global usage, and cultural sensitivity is an essential
deliverable of the Internationalization  Working Group. During the past 2 years the Working Group has reviewed over 80 specifications, and has tracked around 400 issues.
</p>
<p>This is not a
time-bound activity and the exact schedule of these reviews depends on the
progress of other Working Groups and the availability of resources in the
Internationalization Working Group. There is usually a regular supply of
review work to be done. The WG is doing its best to provide horizontal reviews  as early as possible in the specification development process, rather than waiting for Last Call. Review work leads to the raising and tracking of issues related to a technology. Discussions related to these issues are often much more time-consuming than the review itself.</p>
<p>In addition to discussions arising from reviews, the Working Group is often called upon to support other Working Groups with adhoc advice and discussion.</p>
<p>The WG will also maintain checklists and guidance in written form for developers of specifications.</p>

<h3>Author support</h3>
<p>The WG will continue  to publish resources on the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/International/">Internationalization</a>
subsite to assist users of W3C and related Web technologies to internationalize
their applications, content, and services. These will include <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articlelist">articles,
tutorials, notes and reference pages</a>. </p>

<p>
  Over the past 2 years, the group has published 5 new articles, rewritten or significantly updated 6 more, and created and/or published 8 Working Drafts/WG Notes containing detailed technical advice. (This doesn't include documents published during the language enablement work.) The group expects to continue this work during the new charter and create additional materials. These educational materials benefit both specification developers and content authors, and the choice of topics is driven by the needs that arise during developer support or by significant developments related to international use of the Web.
</p>
<p>The Working Group will also maintain the W3C Internationalization  subsite, and develop and maintain ways for users of its resources to quickly
find the material they need, through a variety of means, including topic-based
and task-based indexing.</p>
<p>The WG will also provide internationalization-related best
  practices for users of Web technologies. These documents make the information
  available in a task based fashion, and are accessed by higher level web pages,
  targeted at specific user types and activities, that group together and link to
  all relevant information in summary form, with an organization that aids their
  use.</p>
<h3>Internationalization tests</h3>

<p>The WG will build on the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/International/tests/">existing foundation</a> to create
additional test pages and  summaries of results for the support of internationalization-related features in major browsers. The tests will be made available to the  Web Platform test suite, where appropriate. These tests
explore support by user agents for internationalization related features, but
also serve an educational role. In addition to their support for techniques documents and articles, these tests are being used by content authors and developers of gap-analysis information. In addition, other
W3C WGs have incorporated these tests into their own test suites, and user
agent development teams from all the major browsers have used these tests for
identifying, fixing or enhancing internationalization features or bugs in their browsers.</p>

<h3>Outreach activities</h3>

<p>The WG will seek to regularly present knowledge developed by the WG at
conferences and meetings where Web internationalization topics are relevant. It will also seek out key opportunities to present the
internationalization message to content authors and implementers, and to
encourage the provision of requirements for internationalization of W3C
technologies by in-country experts.</p>
          <h3>Timeline</h3>
<p> WG deliverables are produced on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the
      charter, and the specific topics to be addressed by the working group and
      schedule information cannot be determined far in advance, but are driven by
      the needs and activities of the Web community.</p>

<p>Current work can be tracked using pages such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-request/projects/1">Review Radar</a></li>

</ul>

	</section>

    <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The        Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

    <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>.</p>
<section>
<h3 id="w3c-coordination">W3C Groups</h3>
<p>The Internationalization  WG will work with any W3C Working Group to ensure that
      their deliverables support international use. It will, however, have a special relationship with the:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://w3.org/International/i18n-activity/i18n-ig/"
 >Internationalization Interest Group</a></dt>
  <dd>The Internationalization  WG maintains close contact with the Internationalization IG. The Internationalization IG mailing
    list is notified when resources produced by this WG are submitted to  for review. Notifications are also sent to the IG lists when changes are made to issues in the GitHub repositories belonging to this group.  The Internationalization IG mailing list will also be used for sharing
    teleconference minutes and information about the work of this WG, sending out information about the
    progress of this WG at regular intervals, and soliciting feedback in
    general. Members of this WG are expected to also become members of the
    Internationalization IG to assure a smooth flow of information. The WG will also work closely with the
    task forces in the purvey of the Interest Group to publish documents about layout and 
    similar requirements.</dd>

          <h3 id="external-coordination">External Organizations</h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a></dt>
<dd>The Working Group will work with the WHATWG to ensure that their specifications (such as HTML and Encoding) reflect the needs of the global community of users. This will involve reviewing and tracking specification work, and raising and discussing relevant issues.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a></dt>
<dd>IETF working groups and other IETF activities that define technology
      with impact on Web Internationalization, such as  work related to language tags and URLs.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode Technical Committee
  (UTC)</a></dt>
<dd>A liaison has been established. The Internationalization WG will review Unicode Consortium publications for Web-related internationalization features, where needed.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm">Ecma TC 39 (ECMAScript)</a></dt>
<dd> We will work with Ecma TC 39 on the development of the new EcmaScript Internationalization API Specification standard and the internationalization of the EcmaScript Language Specification (ECMA-262). The EcmaScript standard defines the core of the JavaScript programming language.</dd>
<dt>Supra-national and national standards bodies</dt>
<dd>The work of bodies such as ISO, ISO/IEC JTC1, JIS, and CEN, at
      the appropriate level (working group, subcommittee, technical
      committee,...), especially in so far as they work on general standards
      relevant to the internationalization of W3C technology or on national
      profiles of W3C specifications. Informal or formal contacts will be used
      as appropriate. The main groups, and corresponding areas for liaison,
      currently are:
<ul>
<li>ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 (character encoding, sorting): A formal liaison
          has been approved to track the evolution of ISO/IEC 10646 and to
          input W3C requirements.</li>
<li>ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG20 (characters in identifiers): A formal
          liaison has been approved to track developments and to input W3C
          requirements. The work program of this WG has recently been reduced
          considerably, and so this liaison may expire naturally.</li>
<li>ISO TC 37 and  the language resources community in general (e.g.ELRA), since corpora exchange is key to the language technoloiges needed for the multilingual web, and there is strong trend emerging for language resource sharing to take a semantic web/ RDF based approach</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a></dt>
<dd>The group follows developments in Universal Access that are being worked on by ICANN and related organizations.</dd>
<dt>Localization Industry Standards</dt>
<dd>The WG will work with the Localization industry, where needed,<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff/"></a> to ensure
      representation of the needs of these communities in the work of the
    WG.</dd>
<dt>Conference and publication organizers</dt>
<dd>The WG will maintain contacts with the major conference providers in
      the internationalization and localization fields<i>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>From time to time, the work of the Internationalization Working Group will be dependent on developments in groups outside the W3C. For example, specifications at the Unicode Consortium, or work on IRIs or language tags at the IETF, etc.</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
    </p>
  <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://w3.org/International/i18n-activity/i18n-wg/">Internationalization Working Group home page.</a>
    </p>
<p>This group primarily conducts its technical work using GitHub issues in a variety of <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/i18n-drafts/nav/about#groups">GitHub repositories</a>. Notifications of activity in those repositories and meeting minutes are sent to the public mailing lists of  the Internationalization Interest Group, which can be both read and written to by list subscribers (the Interest Group).</p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
        </p>
<p>There is another mailing list, <a
href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-core/">public-i18n-core@w3.org</a>, which can be used for discussions within the group, where needed. This is a publicly archived list, writeable only by Group members.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
      </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
