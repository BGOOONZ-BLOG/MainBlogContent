<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Gerhard Zehethofer, ForgeRock</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>The biggest business potential can be lifted when the process is fully digitised and automated (ent to end). Many use cases do require the integration of data and stake holders that are not within one organisation or domain. The lack of interoperability between individual data silos and organisational silos is one of the biggest inhibitors and limits the commercial success of many use cases. Today IoT is very fragmented and I will support initiatives that drive interoperability and standardisation. While I agree that IT and OT are two different things, I am convinced that both sides can and must learn from each other and leverage mutual strength.</dd>

<dd>IoT-based supply chain monitoring</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Sascha Meckler, Fraunhofer</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>The modern supply chain is driven by smart transportation equipment, for example boxes or pallets that are equipped with IoT devices. These devices track the cargo’s position and record environmental data during the delivery.<br> The collected data has great potential for optimization and enables new business models. On the other hand, the multitude of interacting devices poses a great challenge for the system architecture and the data integration. Supply chain applications span across the boundaries of the individual enterprises, from the supplier and the logistics provider to the consumer. Each participant has limited control over the IoT devices and their data. This creates the need for standardized interfaces and descriptions of IoT platforms in order to reduce the effort to connect to the smart transportation equipment. In this way, an IoT-equipped container can be easily integrated in every supply chain participant’s IT system.<br> Another essential element in this context is the description of position and sensor data. There are, for example, different representations for positioning data: relative or absolute coordinates and various geodetic systems like the WSG-84 datum. A standardized semantic description of the device and its geographical data is required to provide a common understanding of the received data. With the use of Semantic Web technologies, web services can build on top of the Web of Things to provide meaningful information about the supply process.<br> In our group Data Spaces and IoT Solutions, we pursue the concept of a data space that can process and distribute the incoming data based on its semantic description. In the first draft, microservices process the sensor data that is sent from different Gateways and publish meaningful results to a message broker. By connecting additional information systems, an orchestration engine is able to monitor and control the supply chain processes.<br></dd>

<dd>2nd W3C Workshop WoT. Position Statement from ETSI ISG CIM</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Jose Manuel Cantera Fonseca, FIWARE Foundation e.V.</dd>
<dd>Martin Bauer, NEC Labs Europe</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>This position statement outlines the consensus view of the ETSI ISG CIM Group on future work<br> on the Web of Things W3C standards. The goal of ISG CIM is to develop technical specifications<br> and reports to enable multiple organisations to develop interoperable software implementations of<br> a cross-cutting Context Information Management (CIM) Layer.<br> <br> NGSI-LD is a Group Specification developed by ISG CIM, intended to define a core information<br> model and accompanying REST API to provide, consume and subscribe to context information in<br> multiple scenarios (including federation) and involving multiple stakeholders. It enables close to<br> real-time access to information coming from many different sources (not only IoT).<br> <br> We made a contribution that outlines how NGSI-LD can interwork with the Web of Things. During<br> the coming months, ISG CIM, in collaboration with open source communities, W3C and other<br> stakeholders is planning to contribute to its further development.<br> Concerning next standardisation steps, ISG CIM is welcoming a renewed WoT Working Group<br> focused on progressing towards Recommendation, additional specifications such as the Binding<br> Templates, the Scripting API and/or an extended Thing Description.</dd>

<dd>Standard Behavior Descriptions for the Web of Things</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Victor Charpenay, Friedrich-Alexander Universität</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>This article motivates the need for an extensive behavior description framework as part of the collection of Web standards for the Web of Things (WoT). The existing WoT API represents a good starting point to describe the behavior of 'things', as well as more complex automation systems running on WoT. To make a WoT script easy to expose and exchange, high-level constraints on the 'things' it consumes (and exposes) should be exposed as well.</dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>I am responsible for the research and the study of the Internet and the IoT at Internet Research Institute, Inc. Therefore, I am interested in WoT Working Group at W3C. I have been WoT Working Group for two years.<br> <br> There are a lot of industries and sectors that the IoT has been used in. The IoT have been used in many ways. Each IoT are made of different ideas and concepts. The IoT is complicated. Therefore, it’s important to do a survey and research use cases of the IoT. Because if not, no one can have any ideas of functions that should be implemented and can indicate needs for these functions.<br> <br> Therefore, I think that WoT Working Group should make the research and survey of IoT for WoT.</dd>

<dd>Scripting API for the Web of Things</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Zoltan Kis, Intel</dd>
<dd>Daniel Peintner, Siemens</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>The WoT Scripting API is an optional "convenience" building block in WoT and it is typically used in gateways that are able to run a WoT Runtime. It provides a convenient way to work with a Thing Descriptions and WoT Interactions (Properties, Actions and Events defined by a Thing). It allows extending WoT support to new types of endpoints and implement WoT applications such as Thing Directory. It allows remotely representing and also extending an existing Thing functionality. It allows creating, extending and composing services that use WoT Interactions.<br> <br> The API follows ECMAScript syntax but it is not bound to it. Similar APIs can be implemented in multiple languages and runtimes.</dd>

<dd>It Works! An Open WoT Framework (by Mozilla) Powers My Smart Home</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Kathy Giori, Mozilla</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>During this presentation we will describe how today's problem of many different brand-specific device-to-cloud "silo's" can be fixed. We will demonstrate how to combine vendor-specific things (several brands) into a brand-agnostic smart home, with no dependency on cloud-based user account subscriptions, vendor-specific apps, nor data-centers that process and store your private data. Mozilla's approach to decentralize the Web of Things (WoT) supports three of our core values: privacy, security, and interoperability.<br> <br> Mozilla started with a simple goal. We wanted to bridge off-the-shelf smart home device data to the web, so that web developers everywhere could embrace new applications around IoT, in a private and secure manner. As you might expect, since Mozilla's mission is to protect the open web and put people first, our WoT framework is 100% open source, does not push user data to "the cloud", and already supports a variety of different commercial products. Local and remote management is possible using your own private gateway that serves up a friendly web-based user interface (accessible using any modern web browser).<br> <br> Example supported products include smart bulbs, plugs/outlets, door/window sensors, motion sensors, alarms, leak detectors, temperature, button/dimmer switches, video camera feeds, and more. The magic of interoperability between disparate brands of devices is possible because of Mozilla's "WebThings Gateway" software, that implements our proposed WoT schema (web thing API) at the core, and supports a modular "add-on" framework to bridge data from existing devices to that common core. The gateway application can run on a Raspberry Pi or your own computer, and is packaged to enable support for OpenWrt-based routers (those with sufficient resources).<br> <br> This talk will describe Mozilla's WoT framework and show a live demo of the implementation, so that you too, could install and operate your own private smart home.</dd>

<dd>Expression of Interest on behalf of Conexxus and David Ezell</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>David Ezell, Conexxus</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>I’m writing to express interest on behalf of Conexxus[1] in attending the Web of Things Workshop. I have represented Conexxus (and formerly NACS[2]) as the W3C Advisory Committee representative since 2003. Conexxus and NACS were active in the XML Activity at W3C (chaired XML Schema starting in 2004, participated in XML Protocol), and more recently we’ve co-chaired the Web Payments Interest Group, co-chaired the Web Commerce Interest Group, and participated in the Verifiable Credentials WG.<br> <br> Conexxus is a trade association representing fuel and convenience retail - gas stations and convenience stores. In the US, our industry represents approximately 160,000 retail locations with 2018 sales of $262B US. A large proportion of these retail locations are small businesses. As a substantial part of its mission, Conexxus creates standards for data exchange between various IT systems required to operate a retail location, including payment, fuel control, and retail POS.<br> <br> Creating IoT standards useful to merchants in managing their technology estate has been an elusive goal for us. Vendors are interested in stickiness of their products, and not nearly as interested in interoperability. The Web of Things seems to be emerging as a technology where Conexxus can actually engage in creating and adopting actual standards that will be of tremendous benefit to our members, as well as to our industry.<br> <br> The mission statement for the Web of Things[3] is absolutely on target for Conexxus engagement: “counter fragmentation,” “Web-based abstraction,” and “common format” all speak of important capabilities for emerging Conexxus standards.<br> <br> We are very excited about the contributing to the momentum that seems to be building for the Web of Things, and we welcome the opportunity to attend the workshop in Munich.<br> <br> Best regards,<br> David Ezell, Conexxus<br> <br> [1] https://www.conexxus.org/<br> [2] https://www.convenience.org/<br> [3] https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/cfp.html#introduction<br></dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>In the next few years, the W3C Web of Things (WoT) platform will represent a reference solution toward the deployment of fully interoperable systems, hence unlocking the potential of the IoT paradigm on several use-cases characterized by the current fragmentation of devices and technologies. At the same time, the worlwide adoption of the W3C WoT architecture depends on many factors, including also the availability of support tools that might facilitate the deployment of novel WoT applications or the integration with traditional IoT systems. To this purpose, the paper presents the WoT Store, a complete software platform enabling the discovery and management of W3C Things, the monitoring of its properties and events, and the invoking of actions, all within the same dashboard. In addition, the platform leverages on the semantic description of each Thing with the goal of easing and automatizing the installation and execution of WoT applications, e.g. defining the behaviour of a Thing or implementing mash-up operations from multiple Things. We sketch the main features, the architecture and the prototypal implementation of the WoT Store. Moreover, we discuss the WoT Store capabilities on three IoT use-cases, i.e. industry 4.0, smart agriculture and home automation.</dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>Application development in industry scenarios is usually highly challenging due to the composition of different technologies such as protocols, exchange formats and data models. The W3C Web of Things (WoT) paradigm offers an excellent opportunity to simplify interaction with heterogeneous systems and increase interoperability in IoT applications such as those for industry. As a contribution to the 2nd W3C Web of Things Workshop, this position paper gives a brief insight into the opportunities of WoT, e.g. for use cases from industry, and discusses some white gaps that can be addressed in the future as a new work item for the next period of the W3C Web of Things working group charter.</dd>

<dd>Disrupting domains since 1989, the Web now hits EV charging</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Johannes Hund, EcoG</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>After a slow phase of several decades, the real exponential breakthrough of the internet was when the web technologies spread and were adopted by the public. This democratized the creation of content and applications by adding a developer-friendly unifying application layer to interconnect users and different existing systems (webmailers, chsat portals, newsgroups etc.). The Resulting effect is well known, the exponential growth of websites/applications were leading to world's largest coherent distributed system, an omni-present game changer to nearly everybody's life. 75% of all developers are web developers.<br> <br> The same breakthrough can be anticipated for the IoT, which is reaching even further into the physical world. What was missing is the unifying application layer for IoT, akin extending the web into the internet of things, empowering all web developers to reach out into the physical world.<br> <br> This is "Web of Things" can now become a reality due to the great work of the W3C Groups, with the abstraction and simplification provided by the upcoming standards, this interoperability is at hands reach.<br> <br> At EcoG, we believe that cross-system integration and interoperability are key contributors to the success of any IoT system, including our focus area, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles</dd>

<dd>Next Steps for the Web of Things, Part 1: Identifying and Understanding the Focus Market</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Eric Siow, Intel</dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>Specifications of the initial WoT building blocks have now been published. However, it is not enough to have published a standard: it needs to be adopted into real products and deployed in real applications. Large scale implementation of WoT and commercial success in IoT is difficult because the IoT is not a single market. It is comprised of many different markets with different customers each with different use cases and requirements.<br> <br> Beyond the challenges of heterogeneous market segments, the WoT work has been focused on purely technical problems but has made little effort to rally ecosystem alignment. A holistic approach to standardization requires rallying key stakeholders to implement a single standard or a set of complementary standards that provide a whole solution to the identified market.<br> <br> We propose to divide our discussion of the next steps for WoT into two parts. In the first part, we will discuss problem statements and high-level strategic approaches to solving them. In the second part (covered by a separate position paper) we will discuss technical areas and directions that WoT and W3C should pursue moving forward to execute these strategies.<br></dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>In part 1 of our presentation we identified some key problem areas and strategic directions for the Web of Things. In part 2 we will discuss technical planning to support those strategic directions. Discovery, data management, and interoperability have been identified as key challenges. Certain infrastructure components have also been identified as candidates for further standardization. We need a comprehensive technical plan to address these challenges in a coordinated and effective way. Data models and data modelling technologies are key. We suggest extending and unifying web service and thing descriptions and emphasizing W3C semantic standards RDF and JSON-LD 1.1 as key foundational technologies upon which an interoperable IoT data management approach and unified schema can be based.</dd>

<dd>In this paper, we show a tool for rapid IoT application<br> development by combining Web of Things Thing Description (TD) and<br> Node-RED. The tool, Node Generator, generates a module from a<br> Thing Description. Application Developer can use a Thing<br> as a node on the Node-RED Editor.<br> <br> Currently, the tool does not support for retrieving/discovering<br> TD from semantic metadata. Incorporation of semantic metadata into<br> IoT solution development will gain agility of development.<br> To drive forward this, we expect that Web of Things become<br> a center of sharing best practices and standardization<br> about utilization of semantic metadata of Things.</dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>Integrating different Internet of Things devices from different manufacturers to create a mashup scenario can be a tedious and error prone task that involves studying non- standard datasheets. A Thing Description (TD) as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) can make such a task less complicated by providing a standardized model for describing the metadata and the interface of a Web of Things (WoT) entity. However, a situation where a mashup developer has access to a Thing’s TD before having access to the Thing itself may still arise. A way of simulating devices based only on their TDs is thus helpful during the development process of a mashup. In this work we present a method of creating a virtual Thing that simulates the behavior of a WoT-enabled entity based only on its Thing Description.</dd>

In particular I will report on the GS1 Digital Link standard that gives every product a unique Web identity in the form of a URL. I will also provide an insight on the upcoming EPCIS 2.0 standard and how supply chain and retail data could get a lot closer to the Web through these two new business standards.<br> <br> Moreover, I would like to take the opportunity to discuss how the Web of Things and the work that was done within the W3C WoT WG could be used to positively influence these upcoming standards an work towards a Web of Things that truly covers all the things: from the simplest CPG products to the most complex smart cities.<br></dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>The Web of Things offers a platform-independent solution for interacting with connected devices. An important vertical of the WoT is the transportation domain with, at its core, autonomous systems and among others, connected vehicles. They can be seen as complex artefacts, as they are composed of many sensors and actuators, legacy specifications and safety criticality, which leads to additional challenges for cross-domain interoperability, scalability and safety. In this paper, we argue that the specifications around the Web of Things used with domain specific ontologies such as VSSo and the driving context ontology are relevant for connected vehicles. Our position is that Thing Descriptions require adaptations for complex Things or networks of Things: fine-grained access control and safety impacted by security. We propose a demonstration of a connected vehicle and a discussion on the topics of complex connected things acting as gateways of Things.</dd>

<dd>IoT infrastructures publishing their data on the Web have become pervasive. Nevertheless, data is published under heterogeneous formats and models. In this paper we introduce an interoperability approach based on the WoT ontology, that allows to define contextual data for a given IoT infrastructure, define such infrastructure relaying on the WoT ontology, and fetch its data and translate it into RDF on the fly. Our approach has been implemented in the European h2020 project VICINITY. The main benefits of our proposal are the transparent discovery and distributed access capabilities.</dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of many devices and services producing or consuming data over a network, and, by extension, the internet. There are various protocols and data models used by different vendors of things, or middleware, to expose data and APIs to communicate with and consume data of things. The Web of Things (WoT) addresses IoT’s fragmentation by forming a Web-based abstraction layer capable of interconnecting existing IoT platforms, devices, and cloud services and complementing available standards. Specifications of the Web of Things describe data and interaction models exposed to applications, and communication and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively. At the core of the WoT specifications is the Thing Description, a semantic description of the data and interaction model(s) for a Thing. This helps other Things to perform actions on a Thing, e.g. read or write its properties (the data or state of a Thing). We believe that the WoT can benefit from semantically enhancing a Thing so it contains data values, or state, in the form of self-describing data. This allows powerful semantic processing and reasoning upon its state, and possibly the history of its states. To enable this, we propose a rule-based approach to generate self-describing data from a Thing’s state(s).</dd>

<dd>Alexander Kotsev, European Commission, JRC</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>At the Digital Economy Unit of the Joint Research Centre (European Commission) we have extensive experience with sensor platforms (mainly observing environmental phenomena such as air quality and radiation). Our work, among other things, includes support to EU Member States on (i) the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive for environmental data, and (ii) use of citizen-generated data for policy support purposes. Within this context, we work with solutions, and propose technical guidance for EU Member States that are at large based on international standards such as those produced by ISO and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). With regards to sensor data, we work with the OGC Sensor Observation Service and the OGC SensorThings API standards.<br> My interest in the W3C work, considering the above context relates to the strong desire of our stakeholders to ensure that the aforementioned standard-based solutions do not form a silo, but can ‘blend’ into mainstream ICT. From that perspective, ensuring interoperability, and even adoption of the proposed WoT Architecture for our environmental solutions seems highly appealing. Another potential development that I would be interested in is the investigation of possibilities for improvement of the discoverability of observation data (i.e. IoT data from sensors) on the web, in a manner similar to what is already done by W3C and OGC under the umbrella of the ‘Spatial Data on the Web’ and ‘Data on the Web’ best practices.</dd>

<dd>The Internet of Things (IoT) has already taken off, together with many Web of Things (WoT) off-the-shelf devices, such as Philips Hue lights and platforms such as Azure IoT.<br> These devices and platforms define their own way of describing the interactions with the devices and do not support the recently published WoT standards by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<br> On the other hand, many hardware components that are popular in developer and maker communities lack a programming language independent platform to integrate these components into the WoT, similar to npm and pip for software packages.<br> To solve these problems and nurture the adoption of the W3C WoT, in this paper, we propose a platform to WoTify either existing hardware by downloading new software in them or already existing IoT and WoT devices by describing them with a Thing Description.</dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>Interaction Affordances are central to the W3C Web of Things (WoT): they allow Consumers to identify and use the capabilities provided by Web Things. Ideally, interaction affordances would allow consumers to arrive-and-operate in any W3C WoT environment: given an entry URI, consumers would be able to achieve their tasks in an autonomous manner by navigating the hypermedia and deciding among the various options presented to them at run time. A central challenge then, which is not typically within the scope of Web engineering, is how to design, program, debug, monitor, and regulate such autonomous consumers of Web Things. The engineering of similar autonomous systems has been studied to a large extent in research on multi-agent systems (MAS), and we believe that tapping into the large body of MAS research holds great promise for unlocking the full potential of the W3C WoT. In this position paper, we motivate and present our vision for autonomous systems in the WoT, and support this vision with a prototype for industrial manufacturing. We then discuss some of the challenges and opportunities raised by bringing autonomy to the WoT.</dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is currently standardizing WoT (Web of Things) Thing Description to describe metadata of Things (both physical and virtual) so that Things can know how to interact with each other by understanding the metadata given in the Thing Description. For the data exchanged between Things in particular, the Thing Description uses JSON Schema for the description of the data. JSON Schema can describe data on the Web such as JSON (and XML) quite nicely, however, it is not able to describe legacy (or proprietary) data including CSV, Flat-file or ASN.1. we propose a description system based on JSON Schema which allows one to declaratively describe legacy data format.</dd>

<dd>The Web of Things depends on common semantic vocabularies in order to deliver broad interoperability.

<dd>Michael Koster, Web of Things Interest Group</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>The W3C Web of Things work has delivered a high level abstraction and meta-model for application software to interact with connected things. This work includes concrete protocol bindings that describe exactly how to serialize data and communicate with the connected things, based on the high level meta-model.<br> <br> We propose a Semantic API that allows software to use the meta-model directly, with the underlying system performing the necessary adaptation for 1. Discovery, 2. Event, Action, and Property interactions, and 3. Adaptation to data type, units, range and scale. The adaptation may be done in a system runtime or through code generation.<br> <br> An application using such a Semantic API only needs to know the semantic definitions for the resources it interacts with, and does not need to know any of the underlying details such as transfer protocol, media types, number formats, or engineering units, variations in which are all handled by the runtime or code generator.</dd>

<dd>Types of Semantic Interoperability</dd>

<dd>Milan Milenkovic, IoTsense LLC</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>This is not a topic for presentation but a statement of interest to attend and an issue that might surface in my discussion. I am writing a book on IoT systenms that will include WoT and would like to be up to date on WoT specifications and plans.<br> <br> Re Topic: there are multiple potential uses for interoperability that have somewhat different requirements and probably solutions. It is important to state which specific one is implied in order to facilitate convergence of interoperability discussions. The commonly assumed case is device-to-device interoperability, However, an important variant is what might be regarded as aggregation-level interoperabiity needed to bring diverse sensor data into a common format for big-data processing and analytics. This flavor of interaction is required to enable useful (understandable to applications) large aggregations of data in the cloud to improve effectiveness of analytics, AI and ML algorithms and to allow cross-domain pooling and analysis of data. It requires common or translatable concepts and vocabularies for data and meta-data, as well as contextual annotations for applications to process. It usually does not require interoperability at the the other levels, such as action and event, discovery, protocol bindings. Since this level of interoperability is both important for enabling big data and easier to achieve than device-to-device mode due to fewer requirements, our position is that the two should be called out and treated separately in interoperability discussions and solutions.</dd>

<dd>Ari Keränen, Ericsson</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>The W3C Web of Things technologies provide a promising set of solutions to some of the biggest challenges of interoperable IoT. At the IRTF Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG) we have already long time collaborated with the W3C WoT to tackle these challenges with research and standardization of relevant technologies. As a co-chair of the T2TRG I would like to express my interest to join the workshop to continue the collaboration on future of the Web of Things.</dd>

<dd>Semantic and Social Aspects of the IoT</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Marta Sabou, Siemens, Vienna</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>IoT technologies are set to bring major benefits to a wide range of domains. Of interest to my work are smart manufacturing (Industrie4.0), smart grids, smart buildings/building automation.<br> <br> Within these domains, I am interested both in semantic and social aspects of IoT. Topics related to semantic aspects of IoT include: (1) vocabularies for the semantic description of IoT devices; (2) methods and approaches for efficient and effective creation of semantic markups (e.g., ways to lower the effort of acquiring semantic descriptions); (3) use cases and applications that showcase the benefits of such semantic descriptions, especially in the domains mentioned above; (4) tool stacks that enable the entire lifecycle of semantically-enriched IoT from semantic description creation, to device discovery, storage of semantic knowledge graphs and end-user applications.<br> <br> Additionally to semantic related topics, I am interested in the interface between the Internet of Things and the Internet of People (IoP), since many of the "Things" are personal devices (mobiles, watches) used by people. In this context, it is interesting to consider how traditional IoT enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) are moving towards cyber-physical social systems (CPSS), that is, complex systems which, additionally to spanning the physical (IoT) and cyber-spaces, also take into consideration social aspects such as social networks or behavior patterns of the groups of people using/benefiting from the CPS.<br></dd>

<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>A from-scratch implementation has been produced using the WoT draft. A servient comprising a thing directory, proxy and a series of protocol binding templates was constructed. Then a client application was created to gauge the standards’ ease of development. The demonstration things are Ikea Tradfri, TP-Link devices and virtual CoAP devices.</dd>

<dd>Runtime System Adaptation in Web of Things</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Jan Lauinger, TUM</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>For building future industrial systems, the constantly emerging Internet of Things (IoT) requires interoperability between ambient devices. Individual solutions for IoT systems invite re-implementation of well known problems. They thereby slow system development in the IoT. The Web of Things (WoT) tries to achieve interoperability of IoT devices by leveraging well-functioning technology standards of the Web.<br> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) proposes an WoT standardization concept which tackles the problem of re-development of already solved issues. Their standardization concept describes every IoT device with a Thing Description (TD). Based on the TD and associated functionalities, Web as well as IoT services are able to interoperate.<br> This work contributes to TD development by updating the TD testing tool Testbench to latest TD specifications. It moreover transforms the Testbench into a REST service before deploying it to the W3C Bundang plugfest 2018. The work proposes and implements a scalable and adaptive System Description (SD) for WoT mashups. The SD is compatible with the W3C WoT stack.<br> The main contribution of this work indicates that the SD of this work scales approximately linear while<br> keeping verified runtime adaptation. By comparing WoT mashups with single or multiple SDs, it shows that mashups with multiple SDs scale better for larger system sizes.<br> With regard to the WoT research field, this work presents a TD extension with regard to system characteristics. This shows the expandability capabilities of the W3C WoT standardization. Furthermore, the implemented and evaluated SD represents an example to describe and manage WoT mashups in a W3C WoT compatible way. The developed SD mashup is an example for a scalable and adaptive WoT mashup implementation based on a SD concept.</dd>

<dd>H2020 Project: IoT Crawler</dd>
<dt>Author(s):</dd>
<dd>Andreas Fernbach, Siemens AG Österreich</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>The IoT Crawler project aims at a service discovery for large scale IoT applications operating on information sources from heterogeneous domains. To this aim, context management infrastructure based on the Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI) shall be established. This allows applications to issue semantic queries on the context image and hereby get tailored information on the relevant resources. From my perspective, the domains in focus are building automation and energy management.<br> <br> My interest in this WoT Conference lies in gaining insights in current technology trends and ongoing standardization activities in the community. The gained insights shall be incorporated into the IoT interface definitions, information models and ontologies to be developed during the IoT Crawler project.</dd>

<dd>Lukas Krammer, Siemens AG</dd>
<dt>Abstract:</dt>
<dd>Semantic technologies are a key enabler for the Internet of Things. Especially in the area of smart infrastructure (such as building technologies or smart grids) there are a lot of challenges where semantic technologies can be a huge contribution.<br> In particular, I am working in an H2020 project named IOT Crawler which aims at establishing a large-scale infrastructure for searching and ranking in the Internet of Things. Thereby, context management infrastructure based on the Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI) shall be established. This allows applications to issue semantic queries on the context image and hereby get tailored information on the relevant resources. In this project, domain-specific semantic descriptions, interface definitions, information models and ontologies are of importance<br></dd>
