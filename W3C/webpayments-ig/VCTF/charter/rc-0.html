    <h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>

   <p>
There is currently no widely used self-sovereign and privacy-enhancing standard
for expressing and transacting verifiable claims (aka: credentials,
attestations) via the Web.
   </p>
   <p>
These problems exist today:
   </p>
   <ul>
       <li>
There is no standard that makes it easy for users to assert their verifiable
qualifications to a service provider (e.g. my loyalty card number is X, I
have an account at Bank Y, I am over the age of 21, I am a citizen of the USA,
I am a Chartered Financial Analyst, etc.). As a result, manual input and
fraud on the Web are higher than desired.
       </li>
       <li>
In existing attribute exchange architectures (like SAML, OpenID Connect, Login
with SuperProviderX, etc.), users, and their verifiable claims, do not
independently exist from service providers. This means users can't easily
change their service provider without losing or fragmenting their digital
identity. This leads to vendor lock-in, identity fragility (duplication,
confusion, and inaccuracy), reduced competition in the marketplace, and
reduced privacy for all stakeholders.
       </li>
       <li>
There is no interoperable standard capable of expressing and transmitting
verifiable claims that cuts across industries (e.g., finance, retail,
education, and healthcare). This leads to industry-specific solutions that
are costly, inefficient, proprietary, and inhibit users' ability to manage
their digital identities in a cohesive way.
       </li>
   </ul>

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

  <p>
If successful, the Recommendations from this Working Group will
increase some areas of interoperability between the entities that issue,
store, and inspect verifiable claims.
  </p>

  <p>
The first goal is to create a standard way for users to assert their verifiable
qualifications to a service provider, producing benefits such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
Enhancing website usability by removing the need to manually enter
verifiable claims.
    </li>
    <li>
Improving the detection of fraud, such as false claims and identity theft, by
establishing a standard way to cryptographically verify 3rd party claims.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
The second goal is to ensure that users and their claims can be independent
from service providers, producing benefits such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
Improving operational efficiency, by reducing operating costs (for example),
for verifiable claim issuers and inspectors as a result of a common set of
technology for expressing and verifying claims.
    </li>
    <li>
Reducing vendor lock-in by ensuring that verifiable claims are portable from
one claims repository to another.
    </li>
    <li>
Enhancing some aspects of privacy and unlinkability for the subject of a
verifiable claim.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
The third goal is to ensure that there is an interoperable standard capable of
expressing and transmitting verifiable claims that cuts across industries,
producing benefits such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
Reusability of the machine-readable language that expresses verifiable
claims (aka vocabularies) so that a single vocabulary
may suit the needs of a broad set of stakeholders, and
    </li>
    <li>
Extensibility of the vocabularies so that a particular industry vertical may
build extensions on top of existing vocabularies to suit their
industry-specific needs.
    </li>
    <li>
Composability of verifiable claims to express an aspect of one's identity in
a granular way.
    </li>
  </ul>

   <p>
The standardized technologies will, to the extent to which it is
technically feasible, level the playing field for verifiable claims so
that small actors or individuals can make use of the technology on the
same basis as larger corporations, government, or institutions, without
undue or unnecessary barriers.
   </p>

   <p>
For more background information about this group, please see
<a href="faq.html">the FAQ</a>. There are also <a href="../use-cases/">a set of
focused use cases</a> that are suggested as input to the group.
   </p>

    <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

	<p>The Working Group will Recommend:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
a data model and syntax(es) for the expression of verifiable claims,
including one or more core vocabularies.
    </li>
    <li>
a note specifying how these data models should be used with existing
attribute exchange protocols, a recommendation that existing protocols
should be modified, or a recommendation that a new protocol is required to
address the problems stated earlier in this document.
    </li>
  </ol>

	<p>The Working Group will not:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Define browser-based APIs for interacting with verifiable claims. This work may be performed by a future Working Group if there is interest, but is not required for the Working Group to be successful.</li>
    <li>Define a new protocol for attribute exchange. This work may be performed by a future Working Group if there is interest, but is not required for the Working Group to be successful.</li>
    <li>Attempt to address the larger problem of "Identity on the Web/Internet".</li>
  </ol>

	<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>

	<dl>
	  <dt id="claim"><strong>verifiable claim</strong></dt>
      <dd>A machine-readable statement made by an entity that is cryptographically authentic (non-repudiable).</dd>
	  <dt id="credential"><strong>credential (aka attestation)</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A set of verifiable claims that refer to a qualification, achievement, personal quality, aspect of an identity such as a name, government ID, preferred payment processor, home address, or university degree typically used to indicate suitability.</dd>
	  <dt id="self-sovereign"><strong>self-sovereign</strong></dt>
      <dd>A design principle for verifiable claims where the holder of a verifiable claim is in complete control of their identifier, where their verifiable claims are stored, and how they are used.</dd>
	</dl>

    <h3 id="security">Security and Privacy Considerations</h3>

   <p>
In general, the issuers of verifiable claims want to ensure that their
reputation is protected, the holders of verifiable claims want to
ensure their data is protected, and the inspectors of verifiable claims
want to be confident in their claims-based decisions. As a result,
both security and privacy are critical for verifiable claims.
   </p>

   <p>
From a security perspective it is important that verifiable claims are
protected from forgery and that interactions with verifiable claims are
protected from bad actors at all stages of the lifecycle.
   </p>

    <p>
From a privacy perspective it is important that information that is
intended to remain private is handled appropriately. Maintaining the
trust of a verifiable claims ecosystem is important. Verifiable
claims technology defined by this group should not disclose private
details of the participants' identity or other sensitive information
unless required for operational purposes, by legal or jurisdictional
rules, or when deliberately consented to (e.g. as part of a request
for information) by the holder of the information. The design of any
data model and format should guard against the unwanted leakage of
such data.
    </p>

	<p>
The Working Group will work with the security and privacy organizations
listed in the liaisons section of the charter to help ensure that
both security and privacy are considered.
    </p>

    <h3 id="i18n-a11y">Internationalization and Accessibility Considerations</h3>

   <p>
Verifiable claims are made throughout the world and are issued and used by
a variety of organizations and people with varying languages and
levels of disabilities. The technology developed by the working group must
be able to express verifiable claims in a variety of languages and must
be able to be used by people with a variety of disabilities.
   </p>

   <p>
The Working Group will work with the internationalization and
accessibility organizations listed in the liaisons section of the charter
to help ensure that both internationalization and accessibility are
considered.

            call for consensus on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional until 5 working days after the
            publication of the draft resolution. If no
            objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

    <h2 id="about">About this Charter</h2>

   <p>
Research that went into the creation of this charter was performed by the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a>
via the
<a href="http://w3c.github.io/vctf/">Verifiable Claims Task Force</a>.
The research findings can be found in the
<a href="VCTF-final-report.html">Verifiable Claims Task Force Final Report</a>.

The Web Payments Interest Group recommended that the Task Force draft a
charter to determine whether there is consensus within the community
(including those interviewed) for the scope of work.
   </p>


    <p>This charter for the Verifiable Claims Working Group has been created according to <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/groups#GAGeneral">section 5.2</a> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process">Process
        Document</a>. In the event of a conflict between this document or the provisions of any charter and the W3C
      Process, the W3C Process shall take precedence.</p>
