<p>The {{domxref(“IntersectionObserverEntry”)}} interface’s read-only <strong><code>boundingClientRect</code></strong> property returns a {{domxref(“DOMRectReadOnly”)}} which in essence describes a rectangle describing the smallest rectangle that contains the entire target element.</p>

<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>A {{domxref(“DOMRectReadOnly”)}} which describes the smallest rectangle that contains every part of the target element whose intersection change is being described. This value is obtained using the same algorithm as {{domxref(“Element.getBoundingClientRect()”)}}, so refer to that article for details on precisely what is done to obtain this rectangle and what is and is not included within its bounds.</p>
<p>In the general case, however, it’s safe to think of this as the bounds rectangle of the target element.</p>
