Implementations
---------------

The reference font for SMuFL is Bravura, which can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura/releases).
Bravura is provided in OpenType, WOFF, WOFF2 and SVG formats, and is released under the
[SIL Open Font License](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura/releases). The example glyphs
in this specification are all taken from Bravura.

Other SMuFL-compliant fonts are available under a variety of licenses. A list
of such fonts can be found [here](http://www.smufl.org/fonts).

Support for SMuFL-compliant fonts has been implemented by a variety of
applications. A list of applications that support SMuFL can be found [here](http://www.smufl.org/software).
