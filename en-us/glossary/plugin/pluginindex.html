<p>A browser plugin is a software component that users can install to handle content that the browser can’t support natively. Browser plugins are usually written using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI">NPAPI</a> (Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) architecture.</p>
<p>The most well-known and widely used plugin was the Adobe Flash player, which enabled browsers to run {{Glossary(“Adobe Flash”)}} content.</p>
<p>As browsers have become more powerful, plugins have become less useful. Plugins also have a history of causing security and performance problems for web users.</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2021 browser vendors worked on a deprecation roadmap for plugins and in particular for Adobe Flash, and today plugins are no longer supported by any major browsers.</p>
<p>Plugins should not be confused with browser extensions, which unlike plugins are distributed as source code rather than binaries, and which are still supported by browsers, notably using the {{Glossary(“WebExtensions”)}} system.</p>
