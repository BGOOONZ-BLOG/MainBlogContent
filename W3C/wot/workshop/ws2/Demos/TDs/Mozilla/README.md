# Mozilla WebThings Demo

A mixture of virtual and physical devices will be demonstrated, implementing Mozilla's unofficial [Web Thing API](https://iot.mozilla.org/wot/) specification and the following schemas from Mozilla's  [WoT Capability Schemas](https://iot.mozilla.org/schemas/) repository:

* OnOffSwitch
* MultiLevelSwitch
* BinarySensor
* MultiLevelSensor
* SmartPlug
* Light
* MotionSensor
* TemperatureSensor
* LeakSensor
* PushButton
* Camera
* VideoCamera
* Alarm
* ColorControl
* EnergyMonitor

**Note:** Mozilla's Web Thing API specification has some remaining differences with the latest W3C draft of the WoT Thing Description specification. These Thing Descriptions will therefore not currently validate using the ThingWeb Thing Description Playground.
