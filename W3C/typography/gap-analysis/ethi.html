  <h1>Gap analysis checklist<br>
    Ethiopic script for HTML/CSS
  (Draft)</h1>
<section>
<p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as  people expect around the world.
</p>
<p>This page is a checklist of items to consider when investigating the level of support that is provided for a given script or language. If you want to raise an issue or comment against this page, use the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues">github issues list</a>.</p>
<p>Each section starts with a prompt in italicised text, intended to help you think of things that might be addressed in that section. When summarising the situation, try to indicate which languages you are covering with your text. Use separate subheadings where there are divergent issues related to specific languages.</p>
<p>For each section element with a <code class="kw" translate="no">topic</code> class, add one of the following classes to that section tag. Then add any useful comments in the following section element with the <code class="kw" translate="no">details</code> class.<code class="kw" translate="no"></code></p>
<ul>
  <li>ok (no problems)</li>
  <li>na (not applicable)</li>
  <li>advanced (work needed to support advanced applications, such as fine quality book production)</li>
  <li>basic (work needed to support basic styling for basic web page use)</li>
  <li>broken (work needed to enable interoperable semantics, or basic display on the Web).</li>
</ul>

<p>Digits have lines above and below. Modern practice tends to use discreet lines associated with each characters, however older texts used a single line across the whole set of adjacent digits.  This difference is likely due to technology constraints. Presumbaly, a continuous line could be applied using OpenType functionality, but there may be a question about whether a control should allow to switch between one style and the other.</p>

<p>Ethiopic script text uses local counter styles. While some of these are supported by some browsers, the set of symbols used and their order varies by language. Custom counter styles can be created using Firefox only. The CSS spec needs to become a Rec and more browsers need to support it.</p>
