Web Annotation Repository
=========================

Documents produced by the [Web Annotation Working Group](http://www.w3.org/annotation/) of the W3C. The Working Group has published its recommendations, and is now closed; see the separate list of the [published documents](http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/).

This repository is now under the control of the [W3C Open Annotation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/). Everyone is welcome adding issues to the repository, clearly marked as errata or proposals for future work (see the [errata page](https://www.w3.org/annotation/errata/) for the details). The Community group's [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-openannotation/) is another avenue for further discussion; please, join the Community Group if you are interested in the topic.
