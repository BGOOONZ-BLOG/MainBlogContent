<p>The <strong><code>qualityLimitationReason</code></strong> property of the {{domxref(“RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats”)}} dictionary is a string indicating the reason why the media quality in the stream is currently being reduced by the codec during encoding, or <code>none</code> if no quality reduction is being performed.</p>
<p>This quality reduction may include changes such as reduced frame rate or resolution, or an increase in compression factor.</p>
<p>The amount of time the encoded media has had its quality reduced in each of the potential ways that can be done can be found in {{domxref(“RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats.qualityLimitationDurations”, “qualityLimitationDurations”)}}.</p>
