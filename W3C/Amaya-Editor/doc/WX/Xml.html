<h2 id="Support">Editing XML documents</h2>

<h3 id="Loading">Loading XML documents</h3>

<p>Amaya can display any well formed XML document and can format it if there
is an associated CSS stylesheet.</p>

<p>For an XML document that refers to a not-supported DTD or namespace
(different from XHTML, MathML and SVG), Amaya offers a limited support for
the display and for the edition. Indeed, as Amaya does not analyse the
associated DTD, it can not chack the validity of any XML document and can not
get specific information about elements and attributes and about their
organization within the document.</p>

<h3 id="Using">Using style in XML</h3>

<p>If the document is associated to a DTD that Amaya does not understand, the
content of the document is formatted and displayed in a way that reflects the
structure of the document. If there is no style indication, the content of
each element will be shown as a <strong>block</strong>. However, for clarity,
the elements that contain at least a character string are considered to be
<em>inline</em> and are displayed accordingly. Amaya can associate a CSS
style sheet. You can also modify the presentation of the document if you
associate a CSS style sheet to it by means of a <strong><a
href="http://www.w3.org/1999/06/REC-xml-stylesheet-19990629/">xml-stylesheet
PI</a></strong> (processing instruction).</p>

<h3 id="Editing">Editing XML documents</h3>

<p>Generic XML documents editing in Amaya is still experimental. For the
supported samples (XHTML, SVG, MathML), editing follows the same rules as for
the corresponding document type. For the other elements, only the
<kbd>Enter</kbd> command is available in this version :</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the selection is within an element, Amaya splits the selected.</li>
  <li>If a whole non-empty element is selected, Amaya creates a new element
    with the same type next to the selected element.</li>
  <li>If a whole empty element is selected, Amaya creates a sibling for the
    parent of the selected element with the same type.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also edit your XML documents in the <strong>Source view</strong>
and use the <strong>File / Synchronize</strong> command. Your modifications
are then displyed in the formatted view.</p>
