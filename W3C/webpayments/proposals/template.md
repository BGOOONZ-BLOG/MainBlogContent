The goal of this document is to enable people to bring lightweight but
structured proposals to the Working Group for iterative discussion. The result of such discussion might be, for example, further discussion of a new browser capability, or guidance on leveraging an existing browser capability.

We recommend that proposals remain within the scope of the group's charter.

## Introduction

[The "executive summary" or "abstract".
Explain in a few sentences what the goals of the project are,
and a brief overview of how the solution works.
This should be no more than 1-2 paragraphs.]

## Problem Statement and Market Context

* What is the problem? In particular, what end-user needs would this address?
* How big is the problem?
* Who are key stakeholder groups?
* Who would be most likely to implement this?
* Is there a regulatory context to consider?
* What obstacles might their be to adoption?

### Benefits

[Which stakeholder groups (including users) benefit and how?]

### Non-goals

[If there are "adjacent" goals which may appear to be in scope but aren't,
enumerate them here. This section may be fleshed out as your design progresses and you encounter necessary technical and other trade-offs.]

## User Experience Considerations

* Are there specific user experience goals?
* Mockups of user experience can help communicate goals, but recall that user experience details are almost always left to browser vendors to design.

## Assumptions

[What assumptions about the market, user environment, regulatory environment, or other context should be made explicit in order to help understand various perspectives?]

## Requirements and Constraints

[If known, what are requirements or constraints on designs?]

## Stakeholder Feedback / Opposition

[Implementors and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work. If you can, list them here with links to evidence as appropriate.]

- [Implementor A] : Positive
- [Stakeholder B] : No signals
- [Implementor C] : Negative

[If appropriate, explain the reasons given by other implementors for their concerns.]

## Relationship to existing use cases

* Are there use cases in other industry verticals that are relevant?

## References & acknowledgements

[Your design will change and be informed by many people; acknowledge them in an ongoing way! It helps build community and, as we only get by through the contributions of many, is only fair.]

[Unless you have a specific reason not to, these should be in alphabetical order.]
