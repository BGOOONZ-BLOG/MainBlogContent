Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Candiate Recommendations published for CSV on the Web.

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page">CSV on the Web Working Group</a> has just published a Candidate Recommendation for four documents, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-tabular-data-model-20150716/">Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web</a>—an abstract model for tabular data, and how to locate metadata that enables users to better understand what the data holds; this specification also contains non-normative guidance on how to parse CSV files</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-tabular-metadata-20150716/">Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data</a>—a JSON-based format for expressing metadata about tabular data to inform validation, conversion, display and data entry for tabular data</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-csv2json-20150716/">Generating JSON from Tabular Data on the Web</a>—how to convert tabular data into JSON</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-csv2rdf-20150716/">Generating RDF from Tabular Data on the Web</a>—how to convert tabular data into RDF</li>
</ul>


<p>Candidate Recommendation means that the Working Group considers the technical design to be complete, and is seeking implementation feedbacks on the documents. There is are over 600 test cases and a separate <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/tests/">document how to use them and report on implementation results</a>. The group is keen to get comments and implementation experiences on these specifications, either as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues">issues on the Group’s GitHub repository</a> or by posting to <a href="mailto:public-csv-wg-comments@w3.org">public-csv-wg-comments@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>The group expects to satisfy the implementation goals (i.e., at least two, independent implementation for each of the test cases) by October 30, 2015.</p>
