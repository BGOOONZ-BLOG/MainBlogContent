<h2>Agenda</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Dragging and dropping</dd>
<dd>What should the order of the events be and in what spec
should this be placed?</dd>
<dt>Clipboard events</dt>
<dd>Should paste and cut have beforeInput events?</dt>
If so, should these be cancelable? Only in cE=events or also in cE=true?</dd>
<dd>Should copy also have a beforeInput event? What if there is no
editing host involved?</dd>
<dt>History handling (undo/redo)</dt>
<dd>What should the relationship between browser-controlled editing history
and beforeInput event be? Should redo/undo have beforeInput events?</dd>
<dd>If JS handles beforeInput events, should the browser try to figure out
what changes were made? Is that technically possible?</dd>
<dt>Non-cancelable event</dt>
<dd>Previously we talked about the beforeInput event not being cancelable
during a composition. With the splitting of the event into one part in the
ui-events spec and the other in the Input events spec, the cancelable
attribute is in the ui events spec and the isComposing is in the Input
events spec. In the ui-events spec the event is marked as always being
cancelable. Will this work, or do we need to specify that it is not
cancelable during composition?</dd>
<dt>static ranges</dt>
<dd>There is also a proposal at 
<a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-staticrange-to-be-used-instead-of-range-for-new-apis/1472">WICD</a>. Is this what we want, and could it be moved into some spec?</dd>
<dd>We have moved back and forth between offering ranges information on most beforeInput events
or only using it if it differs from the current selection. We need to
decide one.</dd>
<dt>Opt-in/opt-out of editing features and menus</dt>
<dd>Context menus currently exist for formatting (on Safari) and for clipboard
related actions (other browsers)<dd>
<dd>These four points could possibly be combined into a proposal that works
for everyone:
<ul>
<li>JS editor developers have asked for a way to be able to disable
context menus (especially on mobile).</li>
<li>Hallvord Steen (Clipboard API) has defined a way to define how to
disable clipboard actions in the standard context menu (beforeCopy,
beforePaste, etc. events which are triggered at the moment the menu is
potentially shown) but he is not happy with the implementation and wonders
if we could do something better in the editing taskforce.</li>
<li>It was <a href="https://github.com/w3c/editing/issues/93">proposed</a>
at the editing meeting at TPAC to create a way to opt-in/out of
features which would then also disable/enable corresponding
editing menus</li>
<li>Which spec should this go into? (input events being one option)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Relation to execCommand</dt>
<dd>Does it really make sense to try to
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/editing/issues/79">cover all execCommand
commands with beforeInput types</a>? How about "copy" which doesn't
change the DOM, or commands such as "insertImage" or "foreColor" which
will recreate custom UI anyway? Is the current selection of editing commands all we want/need?</dd>
<dt>Data and transferData attributes</dt>
<dd>What should the relation between the two be? See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/editing/issues/131">Issue 131</a>.</dd>
<dt>IME input for European languages on long-keypress (Mac OS X, optional)</dt>
<dd>a regular keyboard input can turn into an IME-input if the key is held down for a long time. If the JS handles the event, the IME is not started. How can we make this work when we switch to the beforeinput event? See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/editing/issues/132">Issue 132</a>.</dd>
<dt>Set Virtual Keyboard Enter Key Text</dt>
<dd>Perhaps we need to specify a key text attribute like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-mozactionhint">Mozilla mozactionhint</a></dd>
<dt>Adjust Virtual Keyboard Type</dt>
<dd>inputmode attribute isn't specified for content-editable. But inputmode actually doesn't cover all the types of virtual keyboards. What should we do? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1byGrlstGjZ7jGk0ZjP23AtlNB2Rfe6iSZtREszHLeAI/edit?usp=sharing">iOS and Android Enumerated Types</a></dd>
<dt>Publishing</dt>
<dd>It would be good to get First Public Working Drafts of the things
we are working on.</dd>
