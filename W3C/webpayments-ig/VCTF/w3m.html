<h1 id="title">Verifiable Claims Working Group Proposal</h1>

<p>
This is a proposal for the creation of a Verifiable Claims Working Group
at W3C. This proposal has been put forward by a number of W3C member
companies and community groups for examination by the greater W3C
community. This work has been incubated for the past two years in
the W3C Web Payments Community Group, the W3C Credentials Community
Group and for the past six months in the Verifiable Claims Task Force.
The following documents have been prepared for the W3C Management to evaluate
the proposal.

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="primer/">
Verifiable Claims Primer</a>
- An introduction to verifiable claims for W3C Management. 3 minute read.

  <li>
<a href="charter/rc-3.html">
Verifiable Claims Working Group Draft Charter</a>
- The draft charter that is being proposed for Charter Development approval by

The following changes have been made based on feedback from W3M since W3C TPAC 2016:

      <li>
The Problem Statement and Goals section has been moved into to a
<a href="charter/charter-motivation.html">Charter Motivations</a> document.
      </li>
      <li>
The dates have been adjusted to provide a less aggressive timeline to get to
CR.
      </li>
      <li>
The chairs and staff contact participation have been marked "TBD".
      </li>
      <li>
A <a href="charter/rc-3-diff.html">diff-marked version</a> based on the 
previous charter approved by the Verifiable Claims Task Force has been generated.
      </li>
    </ul>
