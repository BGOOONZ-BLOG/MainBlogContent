      This is a subtitle that has a very large number of characters in order to test text wrapping and general formatting of text.
      It even has multiple sentences to make it longer, which will help test the rendering of text-based subtitles in more extreme
      cases.<br>
      This is another subtitle that has a very large number of characters, primarily so that the previous long subtitle might be
      displayed long enough that someone could possibly be able to read it. This subtitle also has multiple sentences in order to
      lengthen it appropriately. The rendering rate for text subtitles is quite high, especially if only using text and not using a
      number of background colors.<br>
