# Decentralised peer-to-peer Internet of Things.

A decentralised, peer-to-peer (P2P) system is a collection of applications run on several local computers, which connect remotely to each other to complete a function or a task. A decentralised peer to peer overlay network manages connections between human and Internet of Things peers. The participants in the network are the peer nodes. The peer to peer network is scalable and an unlimited number of nodes can participate in the network.

Centralized corporate owned cloud is certainly an easier way to build out IoT platforms; however, the owners, application service providers, cloud service providers and authorities of these topologies have an influence upon the network and can exploit it. They can ban devices, spy on devices, report the activities of devices and compromise the data integrity of the devices. In fact, the government can order the cloud service operators and centralised application providers to do all of these things.

In the near future, the doors, air condition units, and security system of homes will be fully internet connected. The users will be able to control their home automation system from a mobile phone device. It is essential that only the end user has full control over the IoT devices. Decentralised P2P Internet of Things aims to provide users with such exclusive control.
