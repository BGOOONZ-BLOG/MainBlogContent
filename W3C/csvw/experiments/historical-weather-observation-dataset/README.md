# Historical weather observation experiment #
This experiement is based on a [historical weather observation dataset for Camborne][1]. The intent is to examine just how far we can get without needing to resort to external templating - and, in doing so, determine where to draw the line for the functionality required to support _most_ transformations without exposing the user to undue complexity.

## Transformation experiments ##
Different transformation experiments are conducted here:

1. [Literal transformation to RDF Data Cube using the 'multi-measure' approach](rdf-data-cube-multi-measure-approach/README.md).
2. Literal transformation to RDF Data Cube where each observed value is treated as an independent observation (pending).
3. As (2) except that each observation is expressed according to the [om-lite](http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite) ontology that is derived from [ISO 19156:2011 Observations and Measurements][om] (pending).

```

For convenience there is also a [local copy](cambornedata.txt) is also provided.

As can be seen, the raw data is actually fixed-format rather than CSV. 

For reference, the column titles (in line 6) are interpreted as follows:
- `yyyy`: year
- `mm`: month
- `tmax`: mean daily maximum temperature
- `tmin`: mean daily minimum temperature
- `af`: number of days of air front
- `rain`: total rain accumulation
- `sun`: total sunshine duration

### Conversion to standard CSV format ###
[Instructions are provided describing how to import these historical weather observation datasets into Microsoft Excel][2]. Standard CSV format can be exported; a snippet of which is provided below:

For convenience, a [local copy](cambornedata.csv) is provided.

There are a number of characteristics of this CSV file worth noting:
- The first 5 lines are descriptive metadata
- The header row (containing the column titles) is line 6
- Not all columns have titles; the additional columns inserted to capture qualification of the observation values do not provide a title (e.g. estimated `*`, instrument type `#` and quality control status `Provisional`)
- Additional attributes (e.g. unit of measurement) for some columns are provided in line 7; therefore ... 
- The data does not begin until line 8
- A primary key for each row may be comprised from concatenating the values of `yyyy` and `mm`
- The observation values are attributable to the entire month
- The token `---` is used to indicate missing data
- Observation values are considered to be 'measured' unless further qualified with a `*` in the following column in which case they are considered to be estimated
- Values of sunshine duration are measured using a Campbell Stokes recorder unless qualified with a `#` in the following column in which case they are measured using an automatic Kipp & Zonen sensor - the difference in measurement instrument affects how the data values are interpreted
- Rows marked with "Provisional" in the final column are yet to pass through quality control assessment
