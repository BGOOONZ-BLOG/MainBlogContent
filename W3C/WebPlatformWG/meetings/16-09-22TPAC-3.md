## Agenda

### Input Events

* Should we have an inputType for the spellchecker specifically? Previously we deicded to use a more general inputType for all possible spell- and grammarchechers which is now called insertNonText, but given that there are only spell checkers currently, it may be transport more information to use a new inputType like: "insertFromSpellcheck" [1]

* Introduce inputType "deleteByComposition" and fire before "compositionstart" [[2]](https://github.com/w3c/input-events/issues/33)
  * The original decision was to recover to the original state at the end of composition, but this wouldn't help much for cases where JS wants to handle insertion itself, because the revert would happen AFTER a beforeinput triggered piece of JS that calls event.preventDefault(). The problem with this is that it will require a dom-aware diffing mechanism on the JS side and may still include a fair amount of guesswork on the JS side

* Introduce inputType "deleteCompositionText" and "insertFromComposition", fired right before "compositionend" [[3]](https://github.com/w3c/input-events/issues/34)

* After the F2F in San Francisco, it was argued on the part of the Chrome team that the clipboard-related beforeinput events should only deal with dom-insertion and not with clipboard manipulation. These changes have been put into the spec draft. In that connection it was also argued that possible the history-stack-related beforeinput events possibly could be decoupled from the history stack. This would be somewhat different from the discussion at the F2F where the majority argued that the browser-internal history stack is unusable as soon as JS handles at least some types of editing operations. Is this something we need to reformulate in the spec, or does it not really matter, as undo/redo will have to be handled by JS anyway as long as JS preventDefaults some beforeinput events? [4]

* Static Range - finish first draft spec, need to make it official. [Proposal](https://github.com/garykac/staticrange/blob/master/staticrange.md)

* Define "static range potentially affected by event" [5]. While  it's easy to intuitively understand what this means, it seems more difficult to define normatively what part of the DOM can be said to be "affected" [6]. Do we need a definition that makes sure that implementations don't differ, or is this not a realworld concern?

* What inputType we should use for Enter key?
  * Currently we are using 'insertParagraph' and 'insertLineBreak', but it might be confusing when pressing Enter in the middle of a heading element
  * see https://github.com/w3c/editing/issues/149 Surprises #2

  > When pressing the Enter key in the middle of a heading element, a beforeinput event with type==insertParagraph is fired. That's a bit unfortunate name, since often such input will be splitting different kind of blocks, inserting new list items or even outdenting lists. Therefore, in CKEditor, we decided to call this action "enter" as none other name suited it.

#### Event order

* Event order for drag/drop, history, clipboard: Should go into UI events spec? [7]

* Event order between "deleteByDrag" and "insertFromDrop" ([see issue](https://github.com/w3c/input-events/issues/24#issuecomment-247453718))

* When are the events triggered? Domenic Denicola and Anne van Kesteren declare "We don't want the timing of mutation events for any new events." Instead they favor tasks/microtasks [8]. How can this work for our events? Possibly three  microtasks where the first one (beforeinput event) schedules the second one (DOM mutation) only if it has not been preventDefaulted?

* Anne van Kesteren proposes to move the prose about when the beforeinput/input events are fired into "n the specification that defines the action that causes the event to be dispatched. (UI events is rather bad in that it doesn't actually define actions, it just defines some events, some ordering between them, but nothing that amounts to a model.)" [9]
