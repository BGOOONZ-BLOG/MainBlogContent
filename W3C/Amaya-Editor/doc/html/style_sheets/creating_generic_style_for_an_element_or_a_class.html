<h1>Creating a Generic Style for an Element or Class</h1>

<p>When a style attribute is associated with an element, you can use that
element as a model for creating or modifying a style rule by using the
<strong>Create Rule</strong> command.</p>

<h2>Using the Create Rule Command</h2>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To create a generic style for an element or
class:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the element you wish to use as the template. By default the
    selection is set to the character string, and you have to press the
    <code>F2</code> key to select the enclosing element..
    <p class="StepNote"><strong>Note:</strong> You must select only one
    element and this element must have a style attribute.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Create Rule</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong>
    menu. Amaya opens a dialog displaying a list of CSS selectors. This list
    contains all classes that are defined for the current document (including
    those defined in linked CSS style sheets), as well as the element type to
    which the style is associated.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Choose a selector in this list or enter a new class name and click
    <strong>Confirm</strong>. The style of the selected element is then
    associated with the chosen selector and the style attribute is removed
    from the selected element. Its content is moved to the <code>style</code>
    element, in the document <code>HEAD</code>, and all elements matching the
    selector are displayed with the new style.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Associating Classes with Elements</h2>

<p>When you create new classes with the <strong>Create Rule</strong> command,
you can associate these classes with some elements in the document.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose <strong>Apply Class</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong>
    menu.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>A dialog displays all existing classes. Choose one of these classes.
    <p>Amaya displays the selected elements with the style associated with
    the chosen class.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To associate a class with an element, you can also use the
<strong>Attributes</strong> menu. This menu also enables you to delete a
class attribute from an element or to change it (the class attribute is
handled like any other attribute).</p>
