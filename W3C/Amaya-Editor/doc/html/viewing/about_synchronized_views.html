<h1>About Synchronized Views</h1>

<p>All views except the Source view are automatically synchronized. When you
select characters or elements in one view of a document, Amaya automatically
scrolls the other views of the document to show the selected items.</p>

<p>You can edit a document in any view. During editing, the changes you make
are displayed only in the active view. When you select a button bar or menu
command or click in another location, Amaya updates the other views to
display your changes.</p>

<p>Selection and editing commands act always in the document tree. When you
select two elements in a view, the selection is extended to the minimum
sub-tree that includes these two elements, even if some elements are not
displayed in that view. Commands applied to that selection (delete by
example) acts on the whole selection.</p>

<p>The Source view is not automatically synchronized. After making a series
of edits in the Source view, you must choose
<strong>File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Synchronize</strong> to update the other views of
the document. Conversely, when you make changes in any other view, choose
<strong>File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Synchronize</strong> to update the Source
view.</p>

<p>When you synchronize a document, Amaya will re-validate it. If you
introduced markup errors in the source view, Amaya will recover as well as it
can. You should check the document in the Structure or Formatted view after
editing in Source view to ensure that synchronization has done what you
expected.</p>

<p>When you save a document from the Source view or from the Formatted view
(locally or remotely), synchronization occurs automatically. All views
reflect the state of the document at the time it is saved.</p>
