Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of two Web Annotation WG documents as Candidate Recommendations. The publication date is the 22nd of November, 2016.

This is a third publication of the CR documents. I asked for approval at:

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-comm/2016Nov/0277.html

and the director's approval at:

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-comm/2016Nov/0289.html

The documents are as follows
----------------------------

Web Annotation Data Model
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-model-20161122/

Web Annotation Vocabulary
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-vocab-20161122/

The documents will be on the TR space on Monday at the latest; they are, currently, at:

http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/admin/TR/annotation-model/Overview.html

and

http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/admin/TR/annotation-vocab/Overview.html

respectively.

Abstract and Status Sections
----------------------------

See the previous URL-s

The documents on the github repo pass the new pubrules' checker (ie, specberus).

Thanks!

Ivan
