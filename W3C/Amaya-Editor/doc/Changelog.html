<h1>CVS Amaya changes</h1>

<p>This file lists bug fixes and new features introduced in the CVS version of
Amaya since the last release (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html">Amaya 11.3.1</a>)</p>
<ul>
  <li>CSS counters are implemented. However, selectors for properties
    counter-reset and counter-increment are not fully interpreted yet, which
    may generate strange numbers sometimes.</li>
  <li>There was a typo in the SVG doctype.</li>
  <li>The 'Tip of the day' is now different at each launch.</li>
  <li>Add &lt;Key&gt;F1: HelpIndex() in keyboard shortcuts.</li>
  <li>Links that contained more than 200 characters were truncated.</li>
  <li>Add text files (*.txt) in the list of 'known types' for file browser</li>
  <li>CSS: Unicode characters in a "content" property were not interpreted
    correctly.</li>
  <li>CSS: selectors for rules counter-increment and counter-reset were often
    not interpreted correctly.<br />
    Also, display these rules in the list of rules displayed by command
    Format/Show applied style...</li>
  <li>CSS: when some style has just been put on a character string (which
    creates a &lt;span&gt; element), command "Show applied style" did not
    display this new style.</li>
  <li>CSS: setting the "color" property of a selected element after the
    "background-color" property produced inexpected results.</li>
  <li>CSS: Amaya crashed when creating a table of contents that included
    elements using a page-break CSS rule.</li>
  <li>MathML: update entity definitions for MathML (Frédéric Wang).</li>
  <li>MathML: the content of element &lt;annotation-xml&gt; was not displayed
    correctly and could crash Amaya.</li>
  <li>Element &lt;param&gt; within an &lt;applet&gt; was moved by the HTML
    parser outside og the &lt;applet&gt; element.</li>
  <li>When an XHTML document contains errors (such as invalid elements), Amaya
    does not try anymore to parse it again as a plain HTML document if it uses
    other namespaces with prefixes. The HTML parser does not accept prefixed
    tags.</li>
  <li>&lt;object&gt;: Amaya now accept to create &lt;object&gt; elements
    without a data attribute.<br />
    It's also easier to change the alternate text of an &lt;object&gt;.</li>
  <li>Table editing: when changing setting an attribute on several (but not
    all) cells in a column, the attribute was applied to the column as a
  whole.</li>
  <li>It was impossible to save large documents throught SSL on Windows and
    Linux. Add an option to define the socket buffer size in the libwww.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Updating documentation.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
