      <h1>Write spatial data</h1>
      <p>There are a lot of formats, encodings, and vocabularies for writing and representing spatial data and geometry on the Web. This roadmap gives an overview of those that are well-deployed on the Web or under development, but also those that are well-deployed in the geospatial community but less so on the Web. These are in the "Features not covered by ongoing work" section.</p>

        <h3>Generic options for writing spatial data</h3>
        <div data-feature="Encoding any spatial data">
            <p>There are several generic options for writing spatial data which are established standards: </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a data-featureid="rfc7946">GeoJSON</a> is a widely used format which is serialized in JSON and easy for browser-based Web applications to process, but supporting only one coordinate reference system (CRS84 - i.e., WGS 84 longitude/latitude), and geometries up to 2 dimensions (points, lines, surfaces).</li>
              <li><a data-featureid="gml">Geography Markup Language (GML)</a> provides the ability to express any type of geometry, in any coordinate reference system, and up to 3 dimensions (from points to solids) but is typically serialized in XML.</li>
              <li><a data-featureid="gml-sf">GML Simple Features</a> offers a profile of GML: a subset of the myriad of possibilities GML itself offers. The profile contains the most common geometry types as well as restricting the XML structures that may be used.</li>
              <li><a data-featureid="geosparql">GeoSPARQL</a> is an extension of SPARQL, offering geographic query operators, but it also defines a basic ontology for geography, which can be used for publishing spatial linked data.</li>
              <li><a data-featureid="ogc-georss">GeoRSS</a> is a lightweight way to extend existing RSS feeds with simple geographic information. It is an OGC-endorsed community standard. </li>
              <li><a data-featureid="kml">Keyhole Markup Language (KML)</a> can be used to represent spatial things and 0D-3D geometries, mainly focussed  on spatial data visualization and interaction in so-called 'earth browsers'.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <!-- to represent sensor data-->
          <h3>Semantic standards: vocabularies</h3>
          <p data-feature="Sensor description">The <a data-featureid="vocab-ssn">Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN)</a> is an ontology for describing sensors and their observations, the involved procedures, the studied features of interest, the samples used to do so, and the observed properties, as well as actuators. SSN includes a lightweight core ontology called SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample and Actuator) that is able to support a wide range of applications and use cases, including satellite imagery, large-scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructures, social sensing, citizen science, observation-driven ontology engineering, and the Web of Things. SOSA can be used without any reference to the full SSN ontology, which adds numerous classes, properties and axioms to SOSA and can be used for advanced linked data use cases. SSN is underpinned by <a data-featureid="iso-19156-2011">Observations &amp; Measurements</a>, an ISO and OGC standard for describing observations and measurements made by sensors.</p>
          <!-- to represent temporal data-->
          <p data-feature="Temporal data representation">The <a data-featureid="owl-time">Time Ontology</a> contains concepts for describing the temporal properties of resources in the world or described in Web pages, including relations between time instants and intervals, information about durations, and temporal position including date-time information. Not only the conventional (Gregorian) calendar and clock can be used: other temporal reference systems are also possible.</p>
          <!-- to represent multi-dimensional data -->          
          <div data-feature="Data cubes">To represent multi-dimensional data on the Web as linked data, the <a data-featureid="vocab-data-cube">RDF Data Cube Vocabulary</a> is available. An extension for spatial and temporal data exists, but that part is still exploratory work.</div>
          <!-- to represent geometry-->
          <h3>Geometry</h3>
          <p data-feature="Representation of geometry"><a data-featureid="sfa/wkt">Well Known Text (WKT)</a> is a compact format to represent geometry literals, used in GeoSPARQL and other spatial data representation formats, and supported in most triple stores and some web libraries. <a data-featureid="geohash">Geohash</a> is a convenient way to express a location using a short alphanumeric string. It only supports 0-dimensional geometries (points). </p>
          <!-- to reference a location-->
          <h3>Reference locations</h3>
          <p data-feature="Reference a location by name">There are different ways to reference a location. One is by providing coordinates as can be done using any spatial data representation in which geometry can be represented. If the location is a spatial thing with a name and an identifier, it can be referenced instead of having to provide its coordinates. There are many popular repositories containing sets of identifiers for Spatial Things such as <a data-featureid="geonames">Geonames</a>, <a data-featureid="dbpedia">DBpedia</a>, and <a data-featureid="wikidata">Wikidata</a>.</p>

        <!--WoT Thing Description-->
        <p data-feature="Description of Web-connected devices">The <a data-featureid="wot-thing-description">Web of Things Thing Description</a> specification can be used for lightweight and common representation of 'Things' which are connected to the Web. It lets you describe their metadata and interfaces. The encoding is JSON-LD. The set of terms defined is small, but it is possible to re-use terms from other models such as schema.org or SOSA/SSN. </p>

It can be used with many different encodings including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. The vocabulary defines relevant concepts for spatial data such as Place and Event. </p>
