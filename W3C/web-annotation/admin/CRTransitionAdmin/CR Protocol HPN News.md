Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Candidate Recommendation published for Web Annotation.

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/annotation/">Web Annotation Working Group</a> has just published a Candidate Recommendation for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-protocol-20160712/">Web Annotation Protocol</a> specification. The document describes the transport mechanisms for creating and managing annotations in a method that is consistent with the Web Architecture and REST best practices.</p>

<p>Candidate Recommendation means that the Working Group considers the technical design to be complete, and is seeking implementation feedbacks on the documents. There is a separate <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-annotation-tests/blob/master/README.md">document how to use them and report on implementation results</a>. The group is keen to get comments and implementation experiences on these specifications, either as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-annotation/issues">issues on the Groupâ€™s GitHub repository</a> or by posting to <a href="mailto:public-annotation@w3.org">public-annotation@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>The group expects to satisfy the implementation goals (i.e., at least two, independent implementation for each of the test cases) by September 30, 2016.</p>
