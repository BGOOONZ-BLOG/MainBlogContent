If you're interested in linking to an EPUB from inside an EPUB or identifying an EPUB for an annotation, see   **[LinkingImplementationProposals](LinkingImplementationProposals.md).**

# Implementation Proposals #

  * [LinkingImplementationProposals](LinkingImplementationProposals.md)
  * [LinkingSolutionProCon](LinkingSolutionProCon.md)

# Background #

# Working Assumptions #


  * This specification should be developed with a focus on a quicker initial publication rather than attempting to solve more problems/requirements.
  * This specification should reuse existing standards as much as practical.

# Requirements #

## Highest Priority ##

These requirements must be solved in the initial specification:

  * The specification should specify a technique for creating valid URIs (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) to identify both EPUB and EPUB3 publications
  * The specification must support both EPUB and EPUB3 publications (ideally equally)

## High Priority ##

These requirements must be solved in the initial specification:

  * The specification should include some techniques to identify "fragments" in EPUB Content Documents inside the publication

## Medium Priority ##

These requirements may be solved in the initial specification:

  * The specification should define how these URIs should be resolved
  * The specification should include some techniques to identify "fragments" in non-EPUB Content Documents (continuous media, for example) inside the publication
  * The specification should include techniques for strongly verifying the strength of a link matching a publication or fragment
  * The specification should include techniques for weakly/loosely/fuzzily matching a link to publications or fragments

## Priority TBD ##

Other requirements not yet prioritized:

  * Will M believes that we should strive to create URIs that are human-readable
