  Do not use this method to hide the focus ring. Do not use any
  other method that hides the focus ring from keyboard users, in
  particular do not use a CSS rule to override the 'outline'
  property. Removal of the focus ring leads to serious accessibility
  issues for users who navigate and interact with interactive
  content using the keyboard.
