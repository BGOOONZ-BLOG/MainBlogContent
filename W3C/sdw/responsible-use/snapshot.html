        <p>
            The purpose of this document is to raise awareness of the ethical responsibilities of both providers and
            users of <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> on the web. While there is
            considerable discussion of data ethics in general, this document illustrates the issues specifically
            associated with the nature of <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> and both the
            benefits and risks of sharing this information implicitly and explicitly on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> may be seen as a fingerprint: For an
            individual every combination of their location in space, time, and theme is unique. The collection and
            sharing of individuals <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> can lead to
            beneficial insights and services, but it can also compromise citizens' privacy. This, in turn, may make them
            vulnerable to governmental overreach, tracking, discrimination, unwanted advertisement, and so forth. Hence,
            <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> must be handled with due care. But what
            is careful, and what is careless? Let's discuss this.

        <p>
            The use of data is accelerating, not only owing to increasing technical possibilities like AI and earth
            observation, but also as a result of crises such as <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a> and climate change which
            accelerate the deployment of data and technology. This is happening on a small and local scale, as well as on a large
            and global one. Precisely because these data are potentially personal, and its use is becoming commonplace, it is urgent
            to internalize shared principles for the responsible use of data to achieve greater common value, better data and better
            products. These are preferably intrinsic principles that guarantee the safety and privacy of people, our social values
            and human dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
            This note is a living document, ready to be enriched with ethical wisdom from across the world. Current
            ideas presented in the note are framed by a western perspective, so further international collaboration is
            desired.
        </p>
        <p>
            Too often, data ethics is presented as a solution to avoid the unacceptable consequences of data misuse.
            This note will aim to demonstrate that this conversation is not only necessary out of fear of misuse, but
            more importantly, to unlock full potential of <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial
                data</a>. Users will only contribute their location data if they trust the systems collecting these data
            and drawing inferences from them. These data may, in turn, improve the well-being and sustainability of our
            societies.

        <p>
            The interest and concerns around data ethics have grown over the past few years. Universities offer data
            ethics courses; companies and organizations design and conduct data ethics codes; government institutions
            implement data ethics governance. But what does data ethics mean? A simple search provides a myriad of data
            ethics frameworks, codes and guidelines. They all have the same purpose: to safeguard the responsible use of
            data.
        </p><p>
            Not all data are the same: there are varying degrees of sensitivity. In most jurisdictions, the law accounts
            for the protection of sensitive data, particularly personal data. But can we rely on privacy laws to ensure
            responsible use of data? Perhaps more importantly, does the law determine what is considered responsible?
        </p><p>
            During the first wave of <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a>
            pandemic, governments across the world turned to data specialists for help. Seeing as <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a> is highly contagious, scientists
            have advised policies that ensure (social) isolation of <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a> patients. To control the spread
            of the virus, many countries prioritized the identification and location of these patients. The approach towards this
            policy varied. Some governments, e.g., in China, Israel, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan invited or legally
            obliged citizens to use track and trace <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a> apps. The apps give government
            institutions (indeterminate) access to the users’ personal location data and record their potential <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a> symptoms. The level of intrusion
            varies per app, but all of them hold sensitive information as personal location data are, by definition, sensitive.
        </p><p>
            Not only governments are relying on these tracking apps. Private entities have been acquiring both real time
            and non-real time location information for years. However, as the technology improves, the relationship
            between its application and the societal impact changes. Location data have become a commodity. They are in
            high demand and profitable, but at what cost? And who pays the price? A commoditization of location data has
            the potential to benefit society, but that requires strong legal or communal pressure. Pressure to collect,
            process, visualize, use, and remove the data in a responsible way. So, where should this pressure come from?
            Legislation? Companies relying on location data? Ethical officers employed by these companies?
        </p><p>
            Every role or function that interacts with location data has a responsibility to show ethical leadership.
            That is the only way to incorporate ethics by design into the entire project/process. Based on panel
            discussions, webinars, and workshops about this topic, it is evident that the spatial community is eager
            to show ethical leadership. The only question left is: How?
        </p>

    <section id="spatial-is-special">
        <h2 id="x4-spatial-is-special"><bdi class="secno">4. </bdi>Spatial is Special<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#spatial-is-special"></a></h2>
        <p>
            All domains are special. Space and time, however, are special in how they cut across domains. They are the
            glue that helps us organize knowledge about the world around us. We may be interested in events, such as
            landslides, that appeared within a region to mitigate future risks, or we may be interested in events that
            happen during the same time but in a different region, such as country-specific social distancing measures
            to slow the spread of <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a>. In the
            first case, space remains invariant; in the second case, time is invariant while we are interested in spatial
            differences.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">Spatial data</a> are special in many regards. The regional
            variability in the examples above illustrates two competing properties of spatial phenomena: First, spatial
            heterogeneity describes the challenge to find observations that are prototypical for a particular region. For instance,
            <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a> transmission certainly follows
            specific patterns, but a region may contain an uneven distribution of <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a> hotspots. In terms of location
            privacy, a region may display an uneven distribution of characteristics that lead to different needs for privacy and
            require different degrees of obfuscation. Second, spatial dependence between observations violates traditional
            statistical theory. Put differently, samples are not independent; they covary as a function of their distance. For
            instance, nearby sensors are likely to observe similar amounts of rainfall. With regards to privacy, this implies that
            revealing information about one individual or one location, also reveals information about unsampled nearby people and
            locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            These two competing properties simultaneously drive the abilities and risks associated with spatial
            analytics, e.g., with regards to human movement. We assume that people frequenting the same places (or place
            types) may have other similarities, such as common interests or demographic characteristics. However, great
            care has to be taken when trying to assign properties averaged over a region to individuals, a problem known
            as the ecological fallacy. This is particularly critical as modern information retrieval and recommender
            system utilize a person's location history as a predictive feature. Frequently visiting a health care
            facility is not only indicative of health issues but also of being a health care worker and those two cases
            may be difficult to distinguish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Location information also increasingly triggers actions in the physical world around us , e.g., via
            geo-fencing, or determines which information we receive, creating local information bubbles known as
            hyperlocal media. Unfortunately, masking or perturbing location information comes with its own associated
            risks. For example, it may place a user into a geographic area associated with another person. Similarly,
            users that share their location, e.g., bike trajectory, may be mistaken for another person of the
            substantially larger population of people that do not share their location in real time such as in a recent
            case involving a racially motivated attack by a biker. Finally, the value of spatial and temporal
            information does not scale linearly with size, once a certain spatial and temporal resolution has been
            achieved it becomes possible to monitor people and infer their future behavior on a very fine grained level.
            This includes positive aspects such as finding missing people or preventing crime, but also highly
            problematic cases such as targeting individuals, e.g., for political or cultural reasons.

            <p>
                <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">Spatial data</a>, data about the physical nature of the
                world and about the social and economic activities that take place may be described as Spatio-Temporal
                data, in that it reflects the nature of the world at particular locations at particular times. In simple
                terms an atlas of Europe published in 1912 would represent now historic national boundaries, place names
                etc, in the same way a smartphone map of traffic conditions for San Francisco represents the amount of
                congestion on roads a few seconds previously.
            </p><p>
                With the advent of smartphones and ability to collect and share information about individuals locations
                has become mainstream, it is the ability to place someone at a specific location at a specific time that
                illustrates both the value and the potential risks of such information. It is useful to think of time an
                space and two sides of a coin, an individual can be at only one location at a specific time, and vice
                versa at a specific location at a particular time. In general terms if these data are abstracted or
                reduced in resolution both in terms of time and definition of location the information value is
                decreased along with the inherent risk of exposing an individuals location.

                    a process called geotagging. When social media posts are geotagged to report issues, it transforms
                    the general public into journalists, bringing awareness to things like natural disasters, crimes,
                    etc., often before conventional media reports them.

                    Early awareness affords people the ability to prevent worsening of issues. Early awareness also enables us to

                    masses.

                        In the wake of the 2010 Haitian Earthquake, geotagged "tweets" from eye witnesses using Twitter
                        informed the world of the latest natural disaster in advance of any conventional news. The

                    <p>
                        As more and more people started referring to the disaster, people affected by it, and their
                        desire to contribute toward relief, other applications of the <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> embedded in tweets were thought
                        up. Foremost among these was the harvesting of tweets for integration into disaster management
                        systems like <a href="http://www.sahana.lk">Sahana</a>. The attractiveness of this application
                        even led to guidance on how to structure tweets to improve machine-readability. The linked <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/haiti-quake-propels-twitter-community-mapping-efforts">PBS</a>

                    For the last decade or more mobile maps applications and online map tools have displayed “real time”
                    traffic information as different coloured roads indicating the relative speed of traffic. This speed
                    information often comes from anonymous contributions of speed data gathered from the sensors of
                    individuals' mobile phones who have opted in to share these data with application developers. The
                    widespread use of turn by turn navigation which takes into account traffic congestion can
                    significantly reduce journey times and the resulting pollution.

digital maps for car trips. Commmuters who make use of live traffic data derived from mobile phone locations within navigation systems to find the fastest route through traffic are estimated to have saved,
on average, an additional $10 per person on fuel
per year in 2016.

                    Smartphones and other personal devices which are both able to estimate their location and connect to mobile data networks have the ability of share the operators location explicitly and implicitly with other users connected to the same network. Beyond the users own awareness of location sharing activities there may be unintended consequences of personal location data becoming public, the exif data added automatically by the camera app of a smart phone will pinpoint the phone at a particular location and time, meaning the user cannot be at other location.

                    One evening in June 2020 Peter Weinberg, a marketing executive living in Washington DC began to
                    receive social media message threats as a result of mistaken identity. These threats were to a large
                    extent the consequence of his decision to share his location with an online cycling community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another cyclist had been involved in an altercation on a Washington cycling trail which had been
                    captured on bystanders' mobile phone videos and posted online. Online activists searching for
                    cyclists routes for this particular trail around the time of the altercation incorrectly identified
                    Peter and published his name and address online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr Weinberg was not in the vicinity of the altercation, the time of which was initially incorrectly
                    reported by the Police.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This use case is fully described in the following linked article:

            <p>
                There is a virtuous cycle between data ethics and law, brought about by globalization and the localized
                nature of laws. Where ethical concerns within a region accelerate faster than other areas, legislators
                create laws that provide protections deemed necessary by citizens. These laws often provide templates
                for other regions, potentially influencing prevailing regional ethical concerns. In the case of data
                privacy, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">GPDR</a> has provided a template that many countries have adapted, resulting in
                a framework of rights that have found their way into legal frameworks for privacy. The following rights broadly capture
                these concerns. Three laws were referred to in order that commonality across regions could be confirmed. These were the
                General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">GPDR</a>), California Consumer Privacy Act (<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>), and Australian Privacy Act. Where a right is included in these
                laws, it is indicated under the corresponding right.

            <p>
                The Right of Access gives individuals the right to obtain a copy of the personal information held about
                them. It also includes supplementary information such as the purpose of processing, categories of

            <p>
                The Right to be Forgotten is the right to request erasure of data. If the data have been made public, or

            <p>
                <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> goes further from a location perspective, including geolocation in
                the definition of personal information. This has given rise to a number of additional responsibilities for data
                managers. Privacy policies require updating to reflect any capture of geolocation. Users should be required to opt-in
                with just-in-time notice prior to collection of geolocation. <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> requires
                this consent to be provided separately to any general End User License Agreement, privacy policy, conditions of use, or
                similar document. To comply with the Act, collection of geolocation can only commence after a data manager can prove
                that consent to collect (and transmit if applicable) was given, that consent was not later withheld or revoked, and that
                the captured geolocation precision is not greater than the precision for which consent was given.

            <p>
                It's important to note that the law outlines our minimum compliance requirements. The existing laws give
                people rights, but they don't necessarily protect them. Often people are not necessarily aware that
                their data are being collected and shared because that is hidden somewhere in the privacy statements and
                terms and conditions of use. People rarely read these documents. Equally, people are often unaware of
                their rights, and therefore ill equipped to assert the rights outlined above when they are violated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Individuals rarely feel the risks associated with mass collection of data. This gives great power to the
                collectors and users of the data who may well exploit that power for personal gain rather than
                considering the protection of the individuals and groups that might be harmed and affected by their
                actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                From an ethical standpoint, it is the responsibility of collectors and users of data to protect
                individuals and groups whose data they collect and use. This includes giving them control over their
                data, or to proactively meet the rights discussed above so that people can be confident that their data
                are properly managed. For example, by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>giving people by default clear access to their data;</li>
                <li>giving people by default control and ownership over the collection and use of their data; and</li>
                <li>erasing people's data by default at a certain point unless people opt-out.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Collectors and users of data should take this responsibility seriously, and consider the design choices
                in section <a href="#design-choices" class="sec-ref">§&nbsp;<bdi class="secno">7.3 </bdi>Design Choices</a> in this note.

        <p>
            Worldwide there is a large range of existing ethical frameworks related to data. Developed by national
            governments (like the UK Gov Data Ethics Framework and the USA GSA Data Ethics Framework); by governmental
            organizations (like the United Nations: Data Privacy, Ethics and Protection Guidance Note and the Eurocities
            principles on citizen data); by universities (like the Oxford-Munich Code of conduct for professional data
            scientists); by communities (like the Tech pledge); by companies (like the planet.com code of ethics); by
            <abbr title="Non-Government Organization">NGO</abbr>s (like Unicef’s Ethical Considerations When Using Geospatial
            Technologies for Evidence Generation); and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose, audience and scope of each framework differ a lot. From very abstract to very specific, from
            general principles to detailed instructions, from a wide audience to a single target group.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s relevant to notice that at the highest level, the core values of these frameworks generally correspond.
            They all recognize the importance of transparency, privacy and security, accountability, inclusiveness and
            more. However, they also share the same blind spot: none of the frameworks acknowledge that <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> are special. Even though <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> are both increasingly topical and necessary,
            considering the speed at which it is developing.
        </p>
        <p>
            A noteworthy exception to this are the Unicef ethical considerations. To protect children in unsafe regions,
            the use of <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> is both essential and risky.
            Therefore a critical and detailed assessment of data is crucial.

        <p>
            In this section a framework is presented which identifies some approaches which application and online
            services developers may take to minimize the risk associated with the collection of <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> collected as a result of the movements of
            individuals in time and space, Mobility Data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Privacy preserving techniques should be used to minimize the risk of misuse or disclosure of information
            while at the same time obtaining the benefits associated with a knowledge of individuals locations to offer
            location based services and to provide crucial safety information during emergency situations. A developer
            should ask themselves these questions:
        </p><ul>
            <li>
                Does the user's location provide intrinsic value to my application? If not, it should not be collected.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do I need the user's precise location, or can I selectively reduce its precision without reducing the
                value I provide back to the user? If so, I should reduce location precision.
            </li>
            <li>Do I need to store the user's location? If not, I should use it and then forget it.</li>
            <li>
                How long do I need to store the user's location for? Can I, for instance, remove it after a certain
                period of time? If so, I should remove it as soon as possible.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3 id="x7-1-efficacy-of-mobility-data"><bdi class="secno">7.1 </bdi>Efficacy of Mobility Data<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#efficacy"></a></h3>
            <p>
                With the widespread adoption of smartphones and other devices which have direct or indirect abilities to
                be
                geolocated, the interest in developing new applications and services which make use of this valuable
                information have rapidly increased. The Location Based Services market grew rapidly in the last decade
                but
                not all applications of mobility data were successful, in many cases the expected benefits were not
                achieved.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example an early use case in mobile marketing conceived of a potential customer walking past a shop
                and automatically receiving notifications from the shop owner offering special offers and other
                incentives. The reason this did not happen is that intrusive advertising would not work and would only
                annoy potential customers. In this instance, the use case would not produce the results desired, it is
                an issue of Efficacy – In simple terms would it even work?
            </p>
            <p>
                Other issues may result from the difficulty of using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (<a href="https://www.gsc-europa.eu/gnss-market-applications/gnss-users">GNSS</a>) indoors or in dense Urban
                environments, the power consumption and impact of <a href="https://www.gsc-europa.eu/gnss-market-applications/gnss-users">GNSS</a> receivers on smartphone batteries
                preventing continuous tracking applications. During the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a> pandemic, contact tracing
                applications were limited in efficacy because of concerns that citizen location my have been collected, even though
                these applications were not location based in most cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                To prevent these type of issues realistic operational testing and the development of extensive user
                testing should be undertaken to prove the efficacy of the application before the application is
                introduced and <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> captured as a result.
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-9"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-9" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                Extensive User testing required to prove viability of the application.
            </p></div>
            <p>
                There is context to efficacy of course, you might want to try a technique that is unproven if
                circumstances are severe, a global pandemic might be such an example? If so would it be acceptable to
                experiment first to gather data using a time limited application?
            </p>
            <p>
                Linked to this would be the efficacy of an application over time. While it might be acceptable to
                collect information during an emergency, for example monitoring the location of the population during a
                hurricane evacuation, the location data would and should have no value when the storm has passed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This level of specificity of use is a general requirement of most data protection legislation, in that
                data should only be collected for a particular purpose – so you would be prevented from using the data
                later for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-10"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-10" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                Data collection for specific purposes should be limited in coverage and resolution.
            </p></div>
            <p>
                Related to the temporal aspect of such data collection of course is the spatial context, an application
                collecting information on the movements of a commuter in Paris should not collect data when the user is
                on holiday in London or even Nice. Likewise an app developed to monitor adherence to a quarantine
                requirement should only operate for the duration of the specific event.
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s easy to imagine the development of an application that uses a device's location to validate
                financial transactions to minimize fraud. Transactions will only be valid if the device is at the same
                location as the retail purchase. Such applications have been developed although they have not been
                widely deployed because of questions of efficacy as noted above.
            </p>
            <p>
                But is it acceptable to expect everyone to have a smartphone with Ambient location technology to be able
                to make purchases?
            </p>
            <p>
                Access to services should not rely on access to expensive sophisticated devices. An alternative needs to
                be available for those without or unwilling to use smartphones for example.
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-11"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-11" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                Solutions should be accessible to all members of society.
            </p></div>
            <p>
                Access to technology may also vary for other societal or cultural differences and this may not be easily
                understood or unexpected. It there is an urgent need to build solutions based on ambient location,
                active measures at a governmental level may be needed for example subsidizing the purchase of
                smartphones and or data plans. Another approach may be making available dedicated devices as in the case
                of Singapore’s TraceTogether tokens <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg">https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                It may be the case that for some applications and systems restricting the use of location data
                collection may result in a reduced user experience for example the incognito mode in Google maps cannot
                access your past search history or preferred mode of transport preferences. However such limitations
                should be explained and the decision left to an individual's choice.
            </p>

            <h3 id="x7-3-design-choices"><bdi class="secno">7.3 </bdi>Design Choices<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#design-choices"></a></h3>
            <p>
                For many developers of applications or services that need to implement <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> collection and sharing discussions
                around the ethical approach to take may appear rather esoteric or at least academic in nature. How one
                builds an app or service that uses ambient location in a responsible way is of course a question of
                engineering design choices
            </p>
            <p>
                Here a number of design principles are presented, that are hopefully clear and pragmatic. There will of
                course always be scope for compromises and seldom are choices clearly right or wrong, there must be the
                ability to use a nuanced approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                These design principles are by no means comprehensive but a useful starting point.
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-12"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-12" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                Location Data collection and/or sharing should be voluntary.
            </p></div>
            <p>
                It should be clear the collection and sharing of location data are different things. There are many use
                cases that might require a user's location to be obtained, but the data do not need to be stored on
                device or on a server after the location is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clearly a ride sharing application needs to be able to access your phone's location to arrange the
                dispatch of the closest car. However, the collection of your location data while you are walking about
                for analytical purposes is not necessary for the operation of the service and you should be able to opt
                out of this form of collection if you wish.
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-13"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-13" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                There should be an explicit mechanism to obtain user consent to the collect and then share Ambient
                Location Information.
            </p></div>
            <p>
                Even if the collection and sharing of <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> is
                not optional there should be an explicit notification and ongoing reaffirmation of the user's agreement.
                This is important particularly if location sharing is a background process. Under these circumstances, a
                user interface indication should be provided. Section <a href="#design-language" class="sec-ref">§&nbsp;<bdi class="secno">8.2 </bdi>A Design Language for Location Sharing</a> describes symbols for this
                purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course the user should be able to change their mind and temporarily or permanently stop sharing at a
                time of their choosing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again reinforcing the first principle collection and sharing are separate activities and should require
                separate user consent.
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-14"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-14" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                The purpose of data collection and/or sharing must be explained.
            </p></div>
            <p>
                This is already a key foundation of most good data protection regulations, you need to explain clearly
                why you are collecting location information and how it will be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many public transport providers collect journey information for resource planning purposes. Although it
                might be useful to know passenger movement prior to making their journey, if they don’t state they will
                use the data for that purpose, they must not use it!
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-15"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-15" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                Data Collection/Sharing should be limited in scope.
            </p></div>
            <p>
                Again a key data protection principle is to only collect the minimum amount of data required, there is
                no allowable concept of “nice to have in case we need it”.
            </p>
            <p>
                In spatial terms there is a particular issue with resolution both in terms of time and space, there are
                very few applications outside of turn by turn navigation that require precise real time location data.
            </p>
            <p>
                For your hyperlocal weather forecasting app Wi-Fi or cell based positioning to within a hundred metres
                is easily good enough!
            </p>
            <p>
                Differential privacy provides a promising privacy preserving technique for <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a>. It is based on injecting random noise
                into <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> so that both the level of privacy
                and usefulness of the data is quantified and controlled.
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-16"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-16" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                Data must be kept securely and anonymously by default.
            </p></div>
            <p>
                There needs to be a really, really good reason for Ambient Location information not to be anonymous. For
                most of the current popular applications where Ambient Location information is used to “sense” the
                world, anonymous data are all that is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                It might be that some considerable effort, as in differential privacy, must be applied to data to
                maintain privacy, but there is great risk associated with linking individuals to their location.
            </p>
            <p>
                The recent debate on different approaches to contact tracing, centralized vs. decentralized is
                illustrative here. In both cases the data collected are anonymous however there is greater risk in the
                centralized model that there could be a security compromise and data “could” be identifiable at least
                theoretically.
            </p>
            <p>
                The risk comes from storing the data in one location as opposed to distributed on individual devices.
                Against this risk of course there may be counter arguments that from a perspective of epidemiology it is
                valuable to be able to view the graph of user interactions only possible with a central repository of
                data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of where Ambient Location data are stored it should be secure, encrypted both “At Rest” e.g.
                on the device or server but also “In transit” while moving across the network between device and server.
            </p>
            <div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-17"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-17" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">
                Location data may be Personally Identifiable Information (<abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr>)?
            </p></div>
            <p>
                The data that can be considered to be personally identifiable extends beyond the obvious name, address
                and telephone number and there are grey areas specifically with types of <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any data that, with the favorite legal term of “reasonable effort”, can be used to identify an
                individual data subject is <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr>. So the IP address of the client using your service is <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr>, as is any
                device ID specific to a mobile phone for example such as the <a href="https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=567">IMEI</a>
                or <a href="https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=729">IMSI</a>
                code.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are obvious, but spatial imagery also brings unique challenges. While satellite imagery and aerial
                photography can be argued to be not <abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr> as the resolution of imagery and the generally vertical
                orientation of imagery makes identifying individuals impossible, the same cannot be said for terrestrial
                imagery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because it would be possible to combine an image taken at ground level where an individual could be
                recognized, with metadata of when the image was acquired it is necessary for services such as Google
                Maps Street View and Apple's Look Around to blur faces and car registration plates.

                Is the collection of Ambient Location Information temporary and limited to a defined period of storage,
                and if not why not ? Again of course there may be applications where the user might want data to be
                stored indefinitely. For example, storing location history in Google Maps is a convenient way relive
                travels. However, without the explicit consent from the user, such historic information should be
                removed after a sufficiently short and specified period of time.

                An important emerging technique to ensure the privacy of individuals' location data is differential
                privacy. Differential privacy helps developers of spatial services to derive insights from data while at
                the same time ensuring that those results do not allow any individual's data to be distinguished or
                re-identified. Differential privacy works by injecting noise into statistical or spatial functions,
                reducing resolution of data in time and space while maintaining the information content. Differential
                Privacy techniques crucially also offer testing mechanisms which allow the success of the techniques to
                be quantified and varied in effectiveness for particular use cases.

            The sustained popularity of smartphones has driven down the cost of electronic cameras and <a href="https://www.gsc-europa.eu/gnss-market-applications/gnss-users">GNSS</a> receivers to the point where virtually
            every mobile phone now has the capability to capture geotagged images, making it quick, easy and cheap for the general

            While most users understand the basic precautions required for safe financial transactions online and take
            appropriate steps to protect their personal payment details, many are oblivious to the potential dangers of
            broadcasting their <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a>. Sharing photos of a
            garden barbecue, competing with friends on exercise leaderboards or posting a holiday snap on social media
            are perfectly safe activities provided the user has a clear understanding of the possible pitfalls and takes
            simple measures to mitigate the risks.

                    Sharing personal <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> creates a unique

                    the image’s geotag which could be used to identify their home address. Subsequently posting a

                    decouple it from an individual, unexpected information may still be revealed. For example, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42853072">Strava published a heatmap</a> based on

                Having identified the key factors to consider when sharing or publishing <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> online, the next step is to communicate
                those ideas in a simple manner that is easy to understand and remember for all users, including the

                <p>
                    The first message is to raise public awareness that <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> are as important and sensitive as
                    personal financial details. The public are familiar with basic financial security measures and
                    understand that though there are risks, online transactions can be performed easily and safely with
                    a few simple precautions. The same is true for using <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> responsibly, so people need to be
                    explicitly aware of situations that may involve sharing of location, e.g. sharing geotagged photos,
                    understand the risks and take suitable precautions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important questions to answer when dealing with location data are:

                <ol>
                    <li>What is included?</li>

                <p>
                    Users should expect responsible developers and service providers who collect or use <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> to provide a clear written
                    statement about location data use in their product which answers these three questions and a
                    comprehensible privacy policy. Statements should include comprehensive justification for <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> use and practical steps that
                    users can take to mitigate risks and keep themselves safe without sensationalizing the dangers.
                    Failure to provide such information should serve as a warning to the user that the product should
                    not be trusted as the provider does not deem the safety of their users to be sufficiently important.

                    Developers also have a responsibility to highlight when <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">spatial data</a> are being used. Most modern web

                    access is encrypted or that the browser is accessing the user’s camera or microphone with easily
                    recognized icons such as a padlock for encryption. <a href="https://w3.org/TR/sdw-bp#spatialdata">Spatial data</a> should be similarly represented
                    using a well-known icon such as the location pin so users are aware that their location is visible
                    to others. For example, when a photo is taken using a smartphone, the user interface should clearly
                    display whether or not geotag information is included.

                of the regulator is to outline what controls may be necessary to ensure that individuals are protected from harm and
                breach of privacy.

                Other grey examples include tweets during crises that can be used to actually detect the crisis, but
                also show the user's location in real time. The US Geological Survey Tweet Earthquake Dispatch analyzes
                social media, and uses geolocation combined with machine learning to detect earthquakes. This analysis
                is capable of detecting earthquakes faster than conventional scientific instruments which can take up to
                20 minutes to perform the same task, albeit more accurately. However, the release of information that
                provides a location of activities conducted by a particular target group could be used maliciously. For
                example, geolocation of dating apps could be used by a predator to find common meetup spots where
                individuals will be alone and may not be able to identify them as strangers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Location is often used as the means of achieving data integration. This too has its risks. Data which
                cannot otherwise be linked together can be using the location dimension, and in a way that helps a
                subject to be identified that might otherwise not be.
            </p>
            <p>
                The role of regulators is to provide the guard rails that help provide confidence to users that their
                data will be protected, and to developers that they know their obligations as data managers. To build
                trust, regulators must ensure that user rights and developer obligations are clearly explained, easily
                accessible, and broadly understood. The explanation must cover how each regulation protects the citizen,
                and how they would pursue their rights should a developer breach them. Finally, regulators must also
                ensure that developers are held accountable for breaching their data management obligations.

                    Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources to create a unified view.
                    The resulting data present new knowledge that can be applied toward achievement of social good,
                    business objectives, and personal gain. There are countless examples of data integration being used
                    for positive outcomes for society, including integration of health data to improve the quality of
                    patient centred care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Australia has had the concept of Integrating Authorities for some time. Integrating Authorities
                    undertaking high risk data integration projects involving Commonwealth data for statistical and
                    research purposes are regulated, and must be accredited to ensure that the processes they follow to
                    integrate Commonwealth data create accurate matches, whilst at the same time preserve the privacy of
                    the subjects. The Commonwealth also developed <a href="https://toolkit.data.gov.au/files/High_Level_Principles_for_Data_Integration_Involving_Commonwealth_Data_for_Statistical_and_Research_Purposes.pdf">7
                        High Level Principles for Data Integration</a>. These principles outline, among other things,
                    Custodian and Integrator responsibilities to preserve privacy and confidentiality during integration
                    exercises, along with the need to highlight impacts upon them originating from each exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst restricted to integration of Commonwealth of Australia data, the accreditation provides
                    reasonable guidelines for good practice for integrating data.
