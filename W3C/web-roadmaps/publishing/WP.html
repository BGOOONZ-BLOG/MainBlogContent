                <li><span data-feature="Selectors and States"><a data-featureid="selectors-states">Selectors and States</a></span> may provide the basis for a possible replacement of <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/linking/cfi/epub-cfi-20111011.html">EPUBCFI</a>, i.e., providing a richer way to address and select portions of (HTML) content.

                <li data-feature="Resource Hints">Web Publications may contain a large number of resources; as an optimization step user agents may rely on various prefetch strategies to load those content if the right information is provided by the Web Publication itself. Such optimizations may rely on the <a data-featureid="resource-hints">Resource Hints</a> specification.</li>

                <li data-feature="HTML Extensions">User Agents for Web Publications may have to propose some extensions to HTML (e.g., additional attributes for accessibility). The <a data-featureid="html-extensions">HTML Extension Specifications</a> provides a good starting point for the roadmap to such extensions.</li>
