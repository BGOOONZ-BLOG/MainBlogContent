## Issues ##

### IRI vs URI ###
[List thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-21-working-group/browse_thread/thread/3e2a819ea2216e8b)

  * XHTML: inherits html5 definition of valid URL
  * SVG 1.1: uses IRI (although currently references XLink 1.0, sb 1.1?)
  * MO: uses IRI (via SMIL3)
  * _Package Document ?_

### Version of SVG to reference ###

_SVG 1.1 SE (ED/CR/PR) or SVG 1.1 (REC)?_

  * [Thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-21-working-group/browse_thread/thread/b004236b943caf79)
  * [Issue 63](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=63)

### CSS ###

#### Nature of CSS Profile ####
  * list of css rules that Reading Systems should/must support (as in EPUB 2)
  * also affect content conformance?

#### position:fixed ####
Do we have a solution close at hand, or wait til post-public draft period to settle it?

[Thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-21-working-group/browse_thread/thread/9c555c686c0757d2)

#### CSS encoding ####
[Thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-21-working-group/browse_thread/thread/65ef9f20a84f3b4b)

Note: use of utf-8 or utf-16 is already required by EPUB2, this is carried forward to EPUB3. Do we need to add anything about use of @charset?

### Metadata ###
#### DCMES and DCTERMS language ####
[Thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-21-working-group/browse_thread/thread/52f7b5c063ffabbb)

[Current spec wording (on DCMES and DCTERMS)](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/spec/epub30-publications.html#elemdef-opf-dclanguage)

#### References to external code lists ####
Issue applies to [role](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/spec/epub30-publications.html#propdef-role) and [title-type](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/spec/epub30-publications.html#propdef-title-type).

## WG consensus to submit to board ##
_Call for consensus to recommend to the Board to publish the latest Editors Draft as a proposed Public Draft specification_ (with resolutions above included)

### Mechanisms to collect public input ###
We want one single mechanism to reduce work load and confusion.

  * Suggestion 1: use issue tracker with dedicated tag
  * Suggestion 2: _dedicated mailing list???_

### Draft updates during public review period ###
  * each update dated and announced
  * will use proper diff at top
  * frequency of updates unspecified

## AOB ##
### Next call ###
Suggestion: biweekly calls henceforth unless notification on extra call. Next call: Feb 23.
