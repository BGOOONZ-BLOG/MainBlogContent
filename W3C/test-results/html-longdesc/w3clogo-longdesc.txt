W3C logo image.

The logo of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
is made from the letter W and digit 3 in solid blue,
the top bar of the digit touching the top of the W;
these are followed by a white C with a solid black shadow
to its right and slightly below it, all on a white background so
that the C has no left side but touches the 3 closely enough that
the contour of the 3 provides the left side ot the letter C.

There are horizontal lines the width of the logo above and below.

There is a very small R in a circle denoting a registered
trade mark after the C of W3C.

The logo uses a font called "Base 12 Sans Regular" from Emigre Fonts,
designed by Zuzana Licko in 1995.
