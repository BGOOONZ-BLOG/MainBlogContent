<p>{{APIRef(“Payment Request API”)}}</p>
<p>An object based on {{domxref(“AddressErrors”)}} includes an <strong><code>addressLine</code></strong> property when validation of the address finds one or more errors in the array of strings in the address’s {{domxref(“PaymentAddress.addressLine”, “addressLine”)}}. The returned string explains the error and should offer suggestions for how to correct it.</p>

<p>If an error occurred during validation of the address due to one of the strings in the {{domxref(“PaymentAddress.addressLine”, “addressLine”)}} array having an invalid value, this property is set to a {{domxref(“DOMString”)}} providing a human-readable error message explaining the validation error.</p>
<p>The text should also include, when possible, advice about how to go about correcting the error.</p>
<p>If the {{domxref(“PaymentAddress”)}} object’s <code>addressLine</code> property was determined to be valid, this property is not included in the <code>AddressErrors</code> dictionary.</p>
