This file lists possible future enhancements:

  - Get it to properly handle a function which returns a structure
    or structure pointer where the structure is declared along with
    the function.  [Ack... who programs like that anyway? :-)]

    Example:
       extern struct play {int field;} *play(void) { ... } /* etc. */

    [It should already handle structures within the parameter list.]

  - Get it working on any systems it is not working on, such as IBM PCs.
    [Patches welcome!]

  - Find some way to improve the I/O speed.  Perhaps through the use
    of another method for reading from the pipe?

  - Capture variables and structures as well as functions.

  - Enhance the documentation extraction portion.

  - Get it to work with C++ code as well as C.

  - Provide automatic generation of conditional header files.  [This
    would probably be quite tricky as well as require multiple
    passes ==> slooooow.]

  - Use the standard command argument parsing routines on VMS systems.

  - Better memory management for the buffers and string storage space.
    The arbitrary arrays just don't cut it anymore.

  - Provide option of taking first comment within a function instead
    of first comment before a function.

  - Provide support for very strange functional declarations.
    [Pointers to functions with functions as parameters, far pointers, etc.]

  - Handle far pointers, looking into ANSI C specs on this.

  - Provide a flag to insert a copyright notice into headers automatically.
