This follows the process at https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/review-instructions.html

1. **CREATE A PROPOSED REVIEW COMMENT BY REPLACING THE PROMPTS ABOVE THIS PARAGRAPH, BUT LEAVE THIS PARAGRAPH INTACT AS WELL AS THE TEXT BELOW IT** Then ask the i18n WG to review your comment.

3. After discussion with the i18n WG, raise this issue to the WG that owns the spec. Use the text above this para as the basis for that comment.

4. Replace the text 'link_to_issue_raised' below with a link to the place you raised the issue. Do NOT remove the initial 'ยง '.

5. Edit this issue to remove this paragraph and ALL THE TEXT ABOVE IT.

6. Remove the 'pending' label.
