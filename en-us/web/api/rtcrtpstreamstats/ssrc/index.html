<p>The {{domxref(“RTCRtpStreamStats”)}} dictionary’s <strong><code>ssrc</code></strong> property provides the Synchronization Source (SSRC), an integer which uniquely identifies the source of the {{Glossary(“RTP”)}} packets whose statistics are covered by the {{domxref(“RTCStatsReport”)}} that includes this <code>RTCRtpStreamStats</code> dictionary.</p>

<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>The Synchronization Source (SSRC) is a 32-bit integer uniquely identifying the source of the RTP packets whose statistics are covered by the {{domxref(“RTCStatsReport”)}} object of which this <code>RTCRtpStreamStats</code> object is a component.</p>
<p>The manner in which these values are generated is not mandated by the specification, although it does make recommendations. You should not make any assumptions based on the value of <code>ssrc</code> other than that any two objects with the same <code>ssrc</code> value refer to the same source. See {{RFC(“3550”, "“,”8")}} for additional information about <code>ssrc</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The specification includes an example that generates values for <code>ssrc</code> using MD5. While not part of the standard, exactly, it is a good mechanism that may be used by some browsers; others may use other methods, such as random number generators. <em>Do not</em> rely upon these values meaning anything other than “these objects are associated with the same source.”</p>
