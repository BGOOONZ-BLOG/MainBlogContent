<p class="auth">The <code><a href="#attr-table-border">border</a></code> attribute on 
the <code><a href="#the-table-element">table</a></code> element can be used to provide 
basic fallback styling for the purpose of making tables legible in browsing environments 
where CSS support is limited or absent, such as text-based browsers, WYSIWYG editors, 
and in situations where CSS support is disabled or the style sheet is lost. Only the 
empty string and the value "<code>1</code>" may be used as <code><a 
href="#attr-table-border" style="">border</a></code> values for this purpose. Other 
values are considered obsolete. To regulate the thickness of such borders, authors 
should instead use CSS.</p>
