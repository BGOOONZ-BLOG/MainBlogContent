This range is intended for mixing music symbols with text. Its metrics and glyph registrations should follow the guidelines for fonts intended for text-based applications, even in fonts that are themselves primarily intended for use in scoring applications.

These accidentals should be designed to be complementary to standard letter forms, for example when describing a note name such as “C sharp” or “A flat”.
It is recommended that the stem for the flat is shortened, so that overall the flat has similar proportions to a lower-case letter b. It is likewise recommended that the counters in the sharp and natural are opened up to make them clearer at smaller sizes. This helps to balance the accidentals with the surrounding text.

By contrast, the characters in the [Standard accidentals (12-EDO)](../tables/standard-accidentals-12-edo.md) range and the following ranges are intended for positioning on a staff, and should use the usual proportions.
