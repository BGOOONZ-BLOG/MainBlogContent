Philippe, Ralph,

The CSVW Working Group requests transition to PR status for four specifications on CSV on the Web. The publication is planned for the 24th of November; the documents are follows:

a. Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web
b. Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data
c. Generating RDF from Tabular Data on the Web
d. Generating JSON from Tabular Data on the Web


(1) Document title, URIs, Abstract and Status
=============================================

a. Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web
-------------------------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/syntax/index.html?specStatus=PR;publishDate=2015-11-24
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/PR-tabular-data-model-20151124/

Abstract:

Tabular data is routinely transferred on the web in a variety of formats, including variants on CSV, tab-delimited files, fixed field formats, spreadsheets, HTML tables, and SQL dumps. This document outlines a data model, or infoset, for tabular data and metadata about that tabular data that can be used as a basis for validation, display, or creating other formats. It also contains some non-normative guidance for publishing tabular data as CSV and how that maps into the tabular data model.

An annotated model of tabular data can be supplemented by separate metadata about the table. This specification defines how implementations should locate that metadata, given a file containing tabular data. The standard syntax for that metadata is defined in [tabular-metadata]. Note, however, that applications may have other means to create annotated tables, e.g., through some application specific API-s; this model does not depend on the specificities described in [tabular-metadata].

Status:
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/syntax/index.html?specStatus=PR;publishDate=2014-11-24#h-sotd

b. Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data
---------------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/index.html?specStatus=PR;publishDate=2015-11-24
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/PR-tabular-metadata-20151124/

Abstract:

Validation, conversion, display, and search of tabular data on the web requires additional metadata that describes how the data should be interpreted. This document defines a vocabulary for metadata that annotates tabular data. This can be used to provide metadata at various levels, from groups of tables and how they relate to each other down to individual cells within a table.

The metadata defined in this specification is used to provide annotations on an annotated table or group of tables, as defined in [tabular-data-model]. Annotated tables form the basis for all further processing, such as validating, converting, or displaying the tables.

Status:
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/metadata/index.html?specStatus=PR;publishDate=2014-11-24#h-sotd

c. Generating RDF from Tabular Data on the Web
----------------------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/csv2rdf/?specStatus=PR;publishDate=2015-11-24
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/PR-csv2rdf-20151124/

Abstract:

This document defines the procedures and rules to be applied when converting tabular data into RDF. Tabular data may be complemented with metadata annotations that describe its structure, the meaning of its content and how it may form part of a collection of interrelated tabular data. This document specifies the effect of this metadata on the resulting RDF.

Status:
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/csv2rdf/?specStatus=PR;publishDate=2015-11-24#h-sotd

d. Generating JSON from Tabular Data on the Web
-----------------------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/csv2json/?specStatus=PR;publishDate=2014-11-24
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/PR-csv2json-20151124/

Abstract:

This document defines the procedures and rules to be applied when converting tabular data into JSON. Tabular data may be complemented with metadata annotations that describe its structure, the meaning of its content and how it may form part of a collection of interrelated tabular data. This document specifies the effect of this metadata on the resulting JSON.

Status:
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/csv2json/?specStatus=PR;publishDate=2014-11-24#h-sotd


(2) Proposed publication date, and review dates
===============================================

November 24, 2015. Taking into account the break at Christmas and the New Years' Eve, we would propose the end of the review period on the 15th of January (with a possible publication of the Recommendation on the 26th or the 28th of January).

(3) Records of the decision to request the transition:
======================================================

Decision to request the transition was made on 4th of November:

http://www.w3.org/2015/11/04-csvw-minutes.html


(4) Evidence That Documentation Satisfies Group's Requirements
==============================================================

The requirements satisfied by the document are listed in the use cases and requirements document:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/csvw-ucr/

Editors' draft:
  http://w3c.github.io/csvw/use-cases-and-requirements/

The group intends to publish a final version of the UCR document as a WG Note at the time of publishing the REC; the remaining work is to document how the various requirements are reflected in the final documents.


(4.1) CSV to XML conversion
---------------------------

The charter of the Working Group:
  http://www.w3.org/2013/05/lcsv-charter.html

also included a work item for a csv to XML conversion. The Working Group has repeatedly tried to find XML experts who would have accepted to this work. Nobody volunteered to join the group for this work and, furthermore, the Use case document did not contain any pressing requests to have an XML conversion available. There was a more extensive discussion at the F2F meeting at TPAC:
  http://www.w3.org/2014/10/27-csvw-minutes.html

followed by attempts to talk to people in the XML community. This did not lead to any results. As a consequence, on its F2F meeting in February 2015 the group has resolved to abandon this:
  http://www.w3.org/2015/02/12-csvw-minutes.html#charter

(4.2) Relationship to R2RML
---------------------------

The charter of the Working Group
  http://www.w3.org/2013/05/lcsv-charter.html

required that "The output of the mapping mechanism for RDF MUST be consistent with either the RDF Direct Mapping or R2RML so that if a table from a relational database is exported as CSV and then mapped it produces semantically identical data."

The evolution of the CSVW metadata and mapping, and the differences between the formats and the usages of CSV-s and a Relational Databases did not make it possible to provide a 100% round-trip in all circumstances (although it works in most of the cases). A separate (non-normative) Appendix has been already added to the CR version of the csv2rdf document (and maintained unchanged in the PR) describing the relationships:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-csv2rdf-20150716/#rel-rdb

Note that this Appendix is also an answer to one of the LCCR issues:

  https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues/506


(5) Dispostion of Comments and Changes Since CR
===============================================

The dispostion of all comments received during the Candidate Recommendation phase are part of the github issues' list:

https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22For+Proposed+Rec%22+

All resulting changes are editorial, and the main ones are listed in the respective documents. Two group of issues are worth commenting nevertheless:

1. The list of issues regrouped by the URL:

https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Argrp+label%3A%22For+Proposed+Rec%22

have been submitted by one person. All issues are, in fact, commenting Working Group decisions that go back, in some cases, to more than a year ago. More importantly, none of these issues, or the corresponding arguments, provide any new information or evidence compared to those decisions. After having had several conversations with the commenter it was decided to close all of those with no, or only with minor editorial changes.

2. Issues number 691 and 555 are related to the at-risk feature that was identified and documented in the CR. See separate section on 'at risk' below.


(6) Evidence that the document has received wide review and that issues have  been formally addressed
=====================================================================================================

The group has received and recoreded a number of issues; additionaly, when the Group issued a Working Draft on the 16 April 2015, it also explicitly asked for a wide review (declaring the April version as some sort of a virtual LC). All the comments coming up to this transition have been addressed and resolved satisfactorily:

All issues (removing admin issues):
  https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+-label%3A%22WG+Admin%22

All open issues currently:
  - https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues

All open issues, minus on those on the use case document (non rec-track), on the test suite, on planned non rec-track documents (e.g., a Primer), or administrative issues:

  https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3A%22Use+Case+Document%22+-label%3A%22WG+Admin%22+-label%3A%22Test+Suite%22+
  (http://j.mp/1HfPzdZ)

(Some issues have been postponed to a next version.)

(7) Objections
==============

There were no formal objections.

(8) Features marked as "at risk"
================================

There was one. Its history is documented at:

  https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues/555
  https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues/691

and was documented as 'at risk' in the document:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-tabular-data-model-20150716/#h-issue1

A short summary: the question is around how to locate a metadata file if only the URL of the CSV file are known. While the preferred approach is using the HTTP response header, it is recognized that, for some data publishers, that is not really an option they can use. As a fallback position the April 2015 draft proposed two more *fixed* URI-s, whose exact form was derived from the URI of the CSV file.

The WG asked the TAG for an opinion; after some discussion the TAG decided to advice the usage of .well-known for that purpose. The WG has accepted this, and this solution is now part of the document. However, one commenter started a discussion around this, disputing the TAG's decision:

  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2015Jun/0011.html

but there has been no real consensus on the issue between him and the TAG. To move forward, the WG has decided to flag this solution as an at-risk feature for the CR phase.

The discussion continuted while in CR but, in fact, no new evidence came to the fore, and the TAG publicly maintained its earlier position. Also, the implementation of the feature has turned out to be trivial. As a result, the group decided to keep the feature, and made only minor editorial changes on the matter.


(9) Patent disclosures
======================

No patent disclosures for these documents at the moment

  https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/68238/exclude

(10)  Implementation information
===============================

The CSVW Test Suite:

https://github.com/w3c/csvw/tree/gh-pages/tests

includes slightly over 800 tests, regrouped into tests for RDF and JSON conversions, as well as metadata validation tests, that implemenations must pass in order to be considered as fully conforming for validation and/or for conversion. (Note that an implementation is not required to implement both conversions, i.e., it can function as a validator only.)

A summary of the formal implementation report for the CR phase can be found here:

http://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/implementation_report.html

which shows that, at this moment, there are two implementations that are fully conformant in all categories and, for some categories, there are also partial implementations available. 

Beyond the formal test case report, both Yahoo! (via Peter Mika) and Google (via Dan Brickley) have reported serious interest and also (in the case of Google) serious implementation already, but they are not in a position to share test results at this time. Finally, researchers from Ghent University are working on an extension of R2RML that could also encompass CSV files using the metadata format defined by this Working Group.

The WG intends to keep the test suite on Github for further evolution. The implementation report above is a snapshot for PR reporting, but a corresponding, 'live' version of the implementation results will also remain live, updated time-to-time if new reports come in.
