update_db [-m <module>] <filename> <dbname>

    adds items in the file <filename> to the db with
    the basename <dbname>.  if -m <module> is specified that
    module is used rather than AnyDBM_File.

    file is of the form provided in ../files/infobot-is.txt
    which is to say

       <key> => <value>

    one per line, and <dbname> is something like infobot-is
    
    if the db doesn't exist, it will be created.  if it does
    exists, the entries will be added, potentially overwriting
    entries that exists with the same key.

    NOTE: skips lines that do not contain a => ... you can
    add comments this way.

dump_db [-m <module>] <dbname>

    turns the db into a flat ascii file of the form above.
    try e.g.
 
       dump_db infobot-is
       dump_db -m DB_File infobot-is.db

run_infobots.pl

    you'll need to edit this script to give the right home
    directory, but this is for crontabbing the infobot.  it
    will run it if it's not already running.  this is not
    highly tested!  YMMV.
