They keep pausing as if to work out whether or not what they’re doing is the right thing. The recipe contains lots of jargony text with no illustrations, headings, and structures to supplement the text. <br />Every once in a while granddad and grandson looks quizzically at the recipe and picks up a dictionary, looks up a word and carries on.</td>
