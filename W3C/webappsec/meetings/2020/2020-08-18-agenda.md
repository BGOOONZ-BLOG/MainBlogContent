## WebAppSec WG

[Tuesday, August 18th: 18:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20200818T1800) (11:00 California, 14:00 Boston, 19:00 London, 20:00 Berlin).

### Agenda

* [`IsLoggedIn`](https://github.com/privacycg/is-logged-in)
  * John Wilander and Melanie Richards will walk us through this PrivacyCG proposal.
* [WebID](https://github.com/WICG/WebID)
  * Sam Goto (and friends!) will walk us through this WICG proposal.
* [HTTP State Tokens](https://mikewest.github.io/http-state-tokens/draft-west-http-state-tokens.html)
  * Mike West will update folks on this proposal.
  
Conversations will probably flow around these topics more fluidly than the bullets above suggest, as they're closely related (at least conceptually).
