<p>{{APIRef(“WebRTC”)}}</p>
<p>The {{domxref(“RTCRtpSender”)}} method <strong><code>replaceTrack()</code></strong> replaces the track currently being used as the sender’s source with a new {{domxref(“MediaStreamTrack”)}}.</p>
<p>The new track must be of the same media kind (audio, video, etc) and switching the track should not require negotiation.</p>
<p>Among the use cases for <code>replaceTrack()</code> is the common need to switch between the rear- and front-facing cameras on a phone. With <code>replaceTrack()</code>, you can have a track object for each camera and switch between the two as needed. See the example {{anch(“Switching cameras”)}} below.</p>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">trackReplacedPromise <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">sender</span>.<span class="at">replaceTrack</span>(newTrack)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>newTrack</code> {{optional_inline}}
<ul>
<li>: A {{domxref(“MediaStreamTrack”)}} specifying the track with which to replace the <code>RTCRtpSender</code>’s current source track. The new track’s {{domxref(“MediaStreamTrack.kind”, “kind”)}} must be the same as the current track’s, or the replace track request will fail.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="return-value">Return value</h3>
<p>A {{jsxref(“Promise”)}} which is fulfilled once the track has been successfully replaced. The promise is rejected if the track cannot be replaced for any reason; this is commonly because the change would require renegotiation of the codec, which is not allowed (see {{anch(“Things that require negotiation”)}}).</p>
<p>If <code>newTrack</code> was omitted or was <code>null</code>, <code>replaceTrack()</code> stops the sender. No negotiation is required in this case.</p>
<p>When the promise is fulfilled, the fulfillment handler receives a value of <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<p>If the returned promise is rejected, one of the following exceptions is provided to the rejection handler:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>InvalidModificationError</code> {{domxref(“DOMException”)}}
<ul>
<li>: Returned if replacing the <code>RTCRtpSender</code>’s current track with the new one would require negotiation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>InvalidStateError</code> {{domxref(“DOMException”)}}
<ul>
<li>: Returned if the track on which this method was called is stopped rather than running.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>TypeError</code> {{domxref(“DOMException”)}}
<ul>
<li>: Returned if the new track’s <code>kind</code> doesn’t match the original track.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-that-trigger-negotiation">Things that trigger negotiation</h3>
<p>Not all track replacements require renegotiation. In fact, even changes that seem huge can be done without requiring negotation. Here are the changes that can trigger negotiaton:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new track has a resolution which is outside the bounds of the current track; that is, the new track is either wider or taller than the current one.</li>
<li>The new track’s frame rate is high enough to cause the codec’s block rate to be exceeded.</li>
<li>The new track is a video track and its raw or pre-encoded state differs from that of the original track.</li>
<li>The new track is an audio track with a different number of channels fom the original.</li>
<li>Media sources that have built-in encoders — such as hardware encoders — may not be able to provide the negotiated codec. Software sources may not implement the negotiated codec.</li>
</ul>
