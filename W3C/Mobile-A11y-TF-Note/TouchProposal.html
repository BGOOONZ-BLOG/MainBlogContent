  <h1 class="title p-name" id="title" property="dcterms:title">Mobile Accessibility Proposal</h1>
  
<h2 id="w3c-editor-s-draft-12-february-2015"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">Note: this is an internal rough proposal to the mobile task force, not for re-use outside of the Mobile TF</abbr></h2>
  <p>Proposed discussion and reorganization of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/">Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile</a>. The original wording is kept intact wherever possible, with small adjustments for grammar on proposed new Success Criteria. The new SCs are only slightly tweaked and will need more work. The purpose of this is reorganization is to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Tease out the advice that can be turned into WCAG Guidelines,  Success Criteria, and Techniques</li>
    <li> Document which advice cannot become Success Criteria or suffient techniques in the current wording </li>
    <li>Begin  discussion about whether we can adapt this non SC advisory recommendations into Success Criteria format,  or leave them as advisory (or best practices), or Sufficient Techniques for an existing Success Criteria. <em><strong>We understanding that almost no one follows advisory or best practice advice.</strong></em><strong></strong></li>
    <li>Recommend moving all prose that is not a Success Criteria, Guideline or Technique to the Understanding Doc for these new Success Criteria, Guidelines, etc.</li>
    <li>Turn the information into a form digestible as an Normative Extension Spec. for WCAG 2</li>
</ol>
<p>The two core prerequisites that allow advice to become a Success Criteria for WCAG 2 are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Success Criteria is testable. That means that it is objectively measurable either by automation or expert opinion where most knowledgeable people in the field could determine from the language of the SC whether a particular piece of content fails or passes the SC.</li>
    <li>The Success Criteria is applicable in all circumstances. There are no mobile web sites or applications to which it could not apply.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Summary and conclusions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The big take away is the introduction of a new Guideline 2.5 under which about 5 new Success Criterion where Touch advice would fall. </li>
  <li>There are 11 new Success Criteria. (Some could be demoted to techniques)</li>
  <li>There are 17 New Advisory techniques (some may be reworked to SCs, or allocated to sufficient techniques)</li>
  <li>There are 10 new techniques</li>
  <li>Some of the advice in the document is not testable, or does not apply in all circumstances, which turns them into best practices or advisory under current WCAG formulation. </li>
</ul>

      <p>This document provides informative guidance (but does not set   requirements) with regard to interpreting and applying Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 [WCAG20] to web and non-web mobile   content and applications. </p>
      <p>While the World Wide Web Consortium (<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>)'s <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web Accessibility   Initiative (WAI) is primarily concerned with web technologies, it's guidance   is also  relevant to non-web   technologies. The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>-WAI has published the Note <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/">Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)</a> to provide authoritative guidance on how to apply WCAG to non-web   technologies such as mobile native applications. The current document is   a mobile-specific extension of this effort. </p>
      <p><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/">Mobile Web Initiative</a> Recommendations and Notes pertaining to mobile technologies also include the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/">Mobile Web Best Practices</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/">Mobile Web Application Best Practices</a>.

      <p><em>"Mobile"</em> is a generic term for a broad range of wireless   devices and applications that are easy to carry and use in a wide   variety of settings, including outdoors. Mobile devices range from small   handheld devices (e.g. feature phones, smartphones) to somewhat larger   tablet devices. The term also applies to <em>"wearables"</em> such as   "smart"-glasses, "smart"-watches and fitness bands, and is relevant to   other small computing devices such as those embedded into car   dashboards, airplane seatbacks, and household appliances. </p>
      <p>While mobile is viewed by some as separate from <em>"desktop/laptop"</em>,   and thus perhaps requiring new and different accessibility guidance, in   reality there is no absolute divide between the categories. For   example: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>many desktop/laptop devices now include touchscreen gesture control, </li>
        <li>many mobile devices can be connected to an external keyboard and mouse, </li>
        <li>web pages utilizing responsive design can transition into various screen sizes even on a desktop/laptop, when thenbrowser is zoomed in, and </li>
        <li>mobile operating systems have been used for laptop devices. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, the vast majority of user interface patterns from   desktop/laptop systems (e.g. text, hyperlinks, tables, buttons, pop-up   menus, etc.) are equally applicable to mobile. Therefore, it's not   surprising that a large number of existing WCAG 2.0 techniques can be   applied to mobile content and applications (see Appendix A). Overall, <strong>WCAG 2.0 is highly relevant to both web and non-web mobile content and applications</strong>. </p>
      <p>That said, mobile devices do present a mix of accessibility   issues that are different from the typical desktop/laptop. The   "Discussion of Mobile-Related Issues" section that follows, explains how these   issues can be addressed in the context of WCAG 2.0 as it exists or with   additional best practices. All of the advice in this document can be   applied to mobile web sites, mobile web applications, and hybrid   web-native applications. Most of the advice also applies to native   applications (also known as "mobile apps"). </p>
      <p><em>Note:</em> WCAG 2.0 does not provide testable success criteria   for some of the mobile-related issues. The work of the Mobile   Accessibility Task Force has been to develop techniques and best   practices in these areas. When the techniques or best practices don't   map to specific WCAG success criteria, they aren't given a sufficient,   advisory or failure designation. This doesn't mean that they are   optional for creating accessible web content on a mobile platform, but   rather that they cannot currently be assigned a designation. The Task   Force anticipates that some of these techniques will be included as   sufficient or advisory in a potential future iteration of WCAG. </p>
      <p>The current document references existing WCAG 2.0 Techniques that   apply to mobile platform (see Appendix A) and provides new best   practices, which may in the future become WCAG 2.0 Techniques that   directly address emerging mobile accessibility challenges such as small   screens, touch and gesture interface, and changing screen orientation. </p>

    <p>One of the most common characteristics of mobile devices is the small   size of their screens. This limited size places practical constraints on   the amount of information that can be effectively perceived by users at   any one time, even when high screen resolution might enable large   amounts of information to be rendered.   The amount of information that   can be displayed is even further limited when magnification is used, for   example by people with low vision. See <a href="http://w3c.github.io/Mobile-A11y-TF-Note/#zoom">2.2 Zoom/Magnification</a>.</p>

    <p>Accessibility features geared toward specific populations of people with   disabilities fall under the definition of assistive technology adopted   by WCAG and thus cannot be relied upon to meet the success criteria.

     </h3><div class="comment">(David Comment: Move prose to Understanding Doc)</div>
     <p>A variety of methods allow users to control content size on mobile   devices with small screens. Some of these features are targeted at all   users (e.g. browser &ldquo;pinch zoom&rdquo; features), while others tend to be made   available as "accessibility features" targeted at people with visual or   cognitive disabilities.</p>
     <p><em>Note on reflow</em>: There are important accessibility   differences between zoom/magnification features that horizontally reflow   content, especially text, and those that do not. When text content is   not reflowed, users must pan back and forth as they read each line.</p>
     <p>Zoom/Magnification features include the following: </p>
     <ul>
       <li>OS-level features
         <ul>
           <li> Set default text size (typically controlled from the display settings) <em>Note</em>: System text size is often not supported by mobile browsers. </li>
           <li> Magnify entire screen (typically controlled from the accessibility settings). <em>Note</em>: Using this setting requires the user to pan vertically and horizontally. </li>
           <li> Magnifying lens view under user's finger (typically controlled from the accessibility settings) </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Browser-level features
         <ul>
           <li> Set default text size of text rendered in the browser's viewport</li>
           <li> Reader modes that render the main content without certain types of extraneous content and at a user-specified text size </li>
           <li> Magnify browser's viewport (typically "pinch-zoom"). <em>Note</em>:   Using this setting typically requires the user to pan vertically and   horizontally, although some browsers have features that re-flow the   content at the new magnification level, overriding author attempts to   prevent pinch-zoom). </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>
     <p>The WCAG 2.0 success criterion that is most related to zoom/magnification is </p>
     <div class="successcriteria"> <strong>1.4.4 Resize text</strong> (Level AA) </div>
     <p>SC 1.4.4 requires text to be resizable without assistive technology up to 200 percent. To meet this requirement content must not prevent text magnification by the user.</p>
     <h3><strong>New proposed Success Criteria</strong> for zoom under the new 2.5 Touch Guideline</h3>
     <div class="newsuccesscriteria"><strong>2.5.5 Pinch Zoom: </strong>Ensure       that the browser pinch zoom is not blocked by the page's viewport meta       element so that it can be used to zoom the page to 200%. Restrictive       values for user-scalable and maximum-scale attributes of this meta element       should be avoided. </div>
     <p><em>Note:</em> Relying on full viewport zooming (e.g. not blocking the browser's pinch       zoom feature) requires the user to pan horizontally as well as vertically.       While this technique meets the success criteria it is less usable than       supporting text resizing features that reflow content to the user's chosen       viewport size. It is best practice to use techniques that support text       resizing without requiring horizontal panning. </p>

     <h3 resource="#h-contrast"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading">1.3 Contrast</span><br>
     </h3>
     <div class="comment">(David Comment: Move prose to Understanding Doc)</div>
     <p>Mobile devices are more likely than desktop/laptop devices to be used   in   varied environments including outdoors, where glare from the sun   or   other strong lighting sources is more likely.  This scenario   heightens   the importance of use of good contrast for all users and may   compound   the challenges that users with low vision have accessing   content with   poor contrast on mobile devices. </p>
     <p>The WCAG 2.0 success criteria related to the issue of contrast are: </p>
     <div>
       <ul>
         <li> <strong>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</strong> (Level AA) which requires a contrast of at least 4.5:1 (or 3:1 for large-scale text) and </li>
         <li> <strong>1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)</strong> (Level AAA) which requires a contrast of at least 7:1 (or 4.5:1 for large-scale text). </li>
       </ul>
     </div>
     <p>SC 1.4.3. allows for different contrast ratios for large text.      Allowing different contrast ratios for larger text is useful because     larger text with wider character strokes is easier to read at a lower     contrast.  This allows designers more leeway for contrast of larger     text, which is helpful for content such as titles.  The ratio of     18-point text or 14-point bold text described in the SC 1.4.3 was judged     to be large enough to enable a lower contrast ratio for web pages     displayed on a 15-inch monitor at 1024x768 resolution with a 24-inch     viewing distance.  Mobile device content is viewed on smaller screens     and in different conditions so this allowance for lessened contrast on     large text must be considered carefully for mobile apps. </p>
     <p>For instance, the default text size for mobile platforms might   be   larger than the default text size used on non-mobile devices. When     determining which contrast ratio to follow, developers should strive to     make sure to apply the lessened contrast ratio only when text is   roughly   equivalent to 1.2 times bold or 1.5 times (120% bold or 150%)   that of   the default platform size.  Note, however, that the use of   text that is   1.5 times the default on mobile platforms does not imply   that the text   will be readable by a person with low vision. People   with low vision   will likely need and use additional platform level   accessibility   features and assistive technology such as increased text   size and zoom   features to access mobile content. </p>

<p>With limited screen &ldquo;real estate&rdquo; but a variety of gesture options   available, mobile developers have experimented with a variety of screen   layouts beyond the conventional web paradigm in which the user begins at   the &ldquo;top&rdquo; and generally works down. Some mobile layouts start the user   somewhere in the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; and provide highly dynamic visual experiences   in which new content may be pulled in from any direction or the user&rsquo;s   point of regard may shift in various directions as previously off-screen   content is brought on-screen.</p>

  <p>Mobile device design has evolved away from built-in physical   keyboards (e.g. fixed, slide-out) towards devices that maximize   touchscreen area and display an on-screen keyboard only when the user   has selected a user interface control that accepts text input (e.g. a   textbox). </p>
  <p>However, keyboard accessibility remains as important as ever and   most major mobile operating systems do include keyboard interfaces,   allowing mobile devices to be operated by external physical keyboards   (e.g. keyboards connected via Bluetooth, USB On-The-Go) or alternative   on-screen keyboards (e.g. scanning on-screen keyboards).  </p>
  <p>Supporting these keyboard interfaces benefits several groups with disabilities: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> People with visual disabilities who can benefit from some   characteristics of physical keyboards over touchscreen keyboards (e.g.   clearly separated keys, key nibs and more predictable key layouts). </li>
    <li> People with dexterity or mobility disabilities, who can benefit   from keyboards optimized to minimize inadvertent presses (e.g.   differently shaped, spaced and guarded keys) or from specialized input   methods that emulate keyboard input. </li>
    <li> People who can be confused by the dynamic nature of onscreen   keyboards and who can benefit from the consistency of a physical   keyboard. </li>

<p>Many mobile devices are designed to be primarily operated via   gestures made on a touchscreen. These gestures can be simple, such as a   tap with one finger, or very complex, involving multiple fingers,   multiple taps and drawn shapes.</p>
<p><span class="advisorysuccesscriteria">Gestures in apps should be as easy as possible to carry out. This   is especially important for screen reader interaction modes that replace   direct touch manipulation by a two-step process of focusing and   activating elements. It is also a challenge for users with motor or   dexterity impairments or people who rely on head pointers or a stylus   where multi-touch gestures may be difficult or impossible to perform.   Often, interface designers have different options for how to implement   an action. Widgets requiring complex gestures can be difficult or   impossible to use for screen reader users. </span>Usually, design alternatives   exist to allow changes to settings via simple tap or swipe gestures. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Activating elements via the click event. Using the   mouseup or   touchend event to trigger actions helps prevent unintentional   actions   during touch and mouse interaction. Mouse users clicking on   actionable   elements (links, buttons, submit inputs) should have the   opportunity   to move the cursor outside the element to prevent the event   from being   triggered. This allows users to change their minds without   being   forced to commit to an action. In the same way, elements accessed   via   touch interaction should generally trigger an event (e.g.   navigation,   submits) only when the touchend event is fired (i.e. when   all of the   following are true:  the user has lifted the finger off the   screen,   the last position of the finger is inside the actionable   element, and   the last position of the finger equals the position at   touchstart). <br>

    <p>Another issue with touchscreen gestures is that they might lack     onscreen indicators that remind people how and when to use them. For     example, a swipe in from the left side of the screen gesture to open a     menu is not discoverable without an indicator or advisement of the   gesture.

  <p>In addition to touchscreen gestures, many mobile operating systems   provide developers with control options that are triggered by physically   manipulating the device (e.g. shaking or tilting). While device   manipulation gestures can help developers create innovative user   interfaces, they can also be a challenge for people who have difficulty   holding or are unable to hold a mobile device. </p>

   <p>Some mobile applications automatically set the screen to a particular   display orientation (landscape or portrait) and expect that users will   respond by rotating the mobile device to match.

   <p>Components that are repeated across multiple pages should be   presented in a consistent layout.  In responsive web design, where   components are arranged based on device size and screen orientation, web   pages within a particular view (set size and orientation) should be   consistent in placement of repeated components and navigational   components. Consistency between the different screen sizes and screen   orientations is not a requirement under WCAG 2.0. </p>
   <p>For example: </p>
   <ul>
     <li> A Web site has a logo, a title, a search form and a navigation bar   at the top of each page; these appear in the same relative order on each   page where they are repeated. On one page the search form is missing   but the other items are still in the same order. When the Web site is   viewed on a small screen in portrait mode,</li></ul>

   <h4>Understanding the technique</h4>
   <p>If a user with low vision has the screen magnified only a small   portion of the page might be viewable at a given time. Placing important   elements before the page scroll allows those who use screen magnifiers   to locate important information without having to scroll the view to   move the magnified area. Placing important elements before the page   scroll also makes it possible to locate content without performing an   interaction. This assists users that have cognitive impairments such as   short-term memory disabilities. Placing important elements before the   page scroll also helps ensure that elements are placed in a consistent   location. Consistent and predictable location of elements assists people   with cognitive impairments and low vision. </p>

     <h4>New Success Criteria</h4><div class="newsuccesscriteria"><strong>1.6.1 Triggers Distinguishable:</strong> Elements that trigger changes should be sufficiently distinct to be   clearly distinguishable from non-actionable elements (content, status   information, etc).  </div>
<div class="comment">David Comments: Move prose to Understanding Doc</div>
    <p>Providing a clear indication that elements are actionable is relevant   for web and native mobile applications that have actionable elements   like buttons or links, especially in interaction modes where actionable elements are commonly detected visually (touch   and mouse use). Interactive elements must also be detectable by users   who rely on a programmatically determined accessible name (e.g. screen   reader users). </p>
    <p>Visual users who interact with content using touch or visual   cursors (e.g. mice, touchpads, joysticks) should be able to clearly   distinguish actionable elements such as links or buttons. Existing   interface design conventions are aimed at  indicating that these visual   elements are actionable. The principle of redundant coding ensures that   elements are indicated as actionable by more than one distinguishing   visual feature. Following these conventions benefits all users, but   especially users with vision impairments. </p>
    <p>Visual features that can set an actionable element apart include   shape, color, style, positioning, text label for an action, and   conventional iconography. </p>
    <h4>New Sufficient Techniques for 1.6.1 </h4>
  <div class="technique"> <strong>Conventional shape:</strong> Button shape (rounded corners, drop shadows), checkbox, select rectangle with arrow pointing downwards </div>

    <div class="technique"> <strong>Color offset:</strong> shape with different background color to distinguish the element from the page background, different text color </div>
     <div class="technique"> <strong>Conventional style: </strong>Underlined text for links, color for links </div>
     <div class="technique"> <strong>Conventional positioning:</strong> Commonly used position such as a top left   position for back button (iOS), position of menu items within   left-aligned lists in drop-down menus for navigation </div>
