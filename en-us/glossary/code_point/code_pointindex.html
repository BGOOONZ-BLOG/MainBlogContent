<p>A <em>code point</em> is a number assigned to represent an abstract character in a system for representing text (such as Unicode). In Unicode, a code point is expressed in the form “U+1234” where “1234” is the assigned number. For example, the character “A” is assigned a code point of U+0041.</p>
<p>Character encoding forms, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, determine how a Unicode code point should be encoded as a sequence of bytes. Different encoding forms may encode the same code point as different byte sequences: for example, the Cyrillic character “Ф”, whose code point is U+0424, is encoded as <code>0xd0a4</code> in UTF-8 and as <code>0x0424</code> in UTF-16.</p>
