NAME
     cextrc - C prototype/documentation  extractor  customization
     file format

SYNOPSIS
     .cextrc

DESCRIPTION
     The programs cextract(1)  and  cextdoc(1)  extract  function
     prototypes from C source code and create header and documen-
     tation files respectively.  The .cextrc customization  files
     allow  users to specify which options are set for those pro-
     grams, without having to always use the command line.

     The configuration files are read prior to the parsing of the
     command  line  options, as well as whenever the `-q' flag is
     encountered.

FORMAT
     The file should be a normal text file, with each  customiza-
     tion  command  on a separate line.  Blank lines and any line
     beginning with a `#' will be ignored.

     Any command preceded by the string "doc-only " will only  be
     used  in  documentation  mode,  and  any command preceded by
     "extract-only " will only be used in extraction mode.

     Commands which are preceded by either a `!'  or  the  string
     "no-"  or "no" will be interpreted as disabling that option,
     if appropriate.

COMMANDS
     The full list of configuration commands is given below.

     ansi-code
          If dual-output and merge-output modes are not  enabled,
          produce output in ANSI C format, with full prototyping.
          This command does not do anything when used in documen-
          tation mode.

     break-after-types

     break-types
          When enabled, a newline will be  inserted  between  the
          function  type  and  the  function name in the function
          declarations.

     comments

     yank-comments
          Extract the comment  immediately  before  the  function
          definition, and display it upon output.

     config-file: file
          Read in the specified file and parse it for  configura-
          tion commands.

     cpp-program: program
          Specify which program is to be used as a  C  preproces-
          sor.   This  program  should  resolve all C defines and
          while, hopefully, leaving the comments intact.

     doc-mode
          Enable documentation  mode  with  normal  text  output.
          This is the default setting for cextdoc(1).

     define: expression
          Pass the specified expression  to  the  C  preprocessor
          with  a  "-D"  string prepended to it.  This command is
          equivalent to the `-D' command line option.

     dual-output
          Provide  output  in  both  ANSI  and  K&R  C   formats,
          separated by an "#if __STDC__" ... "#else" ... "#endif"
          construct.  This command does not do anything when used
          in  documentation mode or if the merge-output option is
          enabled.

     externs
          Prepend an "extern" to each function  description  upon
          output.

     extract-mode
          Enable extraction mode and generate output which can be
          used as a C header file defining the prototypes for all
          of the functions which are  encountered.   The  is  the
          default mode for cextract(1).

     first-comments
          Include in the output the initial  comment  encountered
          in each file.

     filename

     prepend-filename
          If the "first-comments" option is enabled, prepend  the
          name of each file to the output of initial comments.

     font % ##
          Assign a troff font "##" to a given font type `%', when
          using  troff  documentation  mode.   The  possible font
          types are `1' or `t', `2' or `c', `3' or `n',  and  `4'
          or `p' for the title, comment, name, and parameter list
          respectively.  The troff font "##" is a normal  one  or
          two  character  troff  font,  such  as "CO" for Courier

          Oblique.

     header-string: string
          When in extraction  mode,  enclose  the  output  within
          preprocessor  directives  testing for the definition of
          string.  This method is used with  many  system  header
          files,  to  insure  that  they are not "#include"d more
          than once.  If this option is not used, the output will
          be enclosed within a "#ifndef __CEXTRACT__", "#endif /*
          __CEXTRACT__ */" sequence instead.

     include: directory
          Pass the specified directory to the C preprocessor with
          a  "-I"  string  prepended  to  it.   This  command  is
          equivalent to the `-I' command-line option.

     merge-output
          Merge the ANSI and K&R output into  a  single  line  of
          output  to make it take up less space.  A macro is used
          to expand the parameter list for ANSI compilers.   This
          option  overrides  both  the  dual-output and ansi-code
          options.  There is no affect if the documentation  mode
          is enabled.

     multi-comments

     multiple-comments
          When extracting comments, assume that consecutive  com-
          ments  are  actually  one  single comment.  This allows
          people that place comment delimiters at  the  beginning
          and  end  of  each line to have their comments properly
          captured.

     output-file: outfile
          Store the output in the specified file.

     replace
          Replace the first  string  which  matches  a  variable,
          type,  or  both  (as  selected) with the second string.
          The format is:
               replace [all/type/variable] "string1" "string2"
          For example, on  Sun  machines,  the  automatic  "FILE"
          replacement could be accomplished using a command like:
               replace type "struct _iobuf" "FILE"
          However, this should not need  to  be  entered  by  the
          average  user since it is handled automatically by cex-
          tract(1), as is the varargs system.

     remove-names

     discard-names
          Remove variable names from the prototype list prior  to

          output.

     roff-mode

     troff-mode
          Enable documentation mode with troff -ms format output.
          This  option  is overridden by the doc-mode or extract-
          mode options.

     show-all

     show-anyway
          When output is K&R C, display prototypes  in  comments.
          When  dual-output is enabled, display comments and pro-
          totypes in both sections; otherwise,  display  comments
          and prototypes only in the ANSI C portion.  This option
          does nothing in documentation mode.

     single-comments
          When extracting comments from a  file,  take  only  one
          comment,   discarding  all  preceding  comments.   This
          option is the reverse of the multi-comments option.

     sort-all
          Alphabetically sort all of the functions  from  all  of
          the files before generating output.

     sort-by-files
          For each file processed,  sort  all  of  the  functions
          prior to output.

     statics

     statics: none

     statics: any

     statics: only
          Select the method for how static  functions  should  be
          treated.   If  "none"  is  selected,  statics  will  be
          ignored.  If "only" is selected,  non-static  functions
          will  be  ignored.   Finally,  "any" indicates that all
          functions will be extracted.  If no selection is  made,
          it  will  be  the  same  as  selecting "any" or (with a
          preceding `!') "none".

     tab-width: width
          Set the tab width to be an integer number width.   This
          works only during documentation generation.

     undefine: name
          Undefine any previously  defined  macro.   If  none  is

          encountered,  pass  the  specified  expression to the C
          preprocessor with a "-U" string prepended to it.   This
          command is equivalent to the `-U' command-line option.

     wrap-parameters: #
          If the length of the  parameter  list  for  a  function
          would  cause it to exceed a given number of columns [72
          by default], a newline will be inserted in place  of  a
          space  character,  so that the function will not exceed
          that given length.  The optional number after the  com-
          mand will override a negation prefix if encountered.

FILES
     /usr/local/lib/cext.config, $HOME/.cextrc, .cextrc
          configuration files.

VMS
     Configuration files  are  also  supported  under  VMS.   The
     default    configuration   files   for   VMS   systems   are
     sys$library:cext.cnf, sys$login:cext.cnf, and cext.cnf.

     Since the VMS C compiler strips out comments, the documenta-
     tion  mode  and  comment options are not very useful.  Using
     the GNU C preprocessor instead might be a possible solution.
