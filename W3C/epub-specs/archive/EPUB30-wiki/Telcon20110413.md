[Issue 107](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=107), Picking up after Murata's earlier request for postponing a decision

_Editor's clarifying introductory notes:_
  * _EPUB3 does **not** relax (as compared to 2.0.1) the rules for resources having to be in the container_
  * _... with the exception of **audio** and **video**, which may be located outside the container, but must still be represented in the manifest_
  * _the reason for making this exception exclusively for audio and video was: **size**_
