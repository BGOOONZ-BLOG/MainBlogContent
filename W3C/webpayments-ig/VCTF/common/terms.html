  This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the
  Open Credentials space by using specific terms to discuss particular concepts. This
  terminology is included below and linked to throughout the document to aid
  the reader:

<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable claims|verifiable claim|claims">claim</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A statement made by an <a>entity</a> about an <a>identity profile</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="repository|credential repositories|credential repository's">credential repository</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a storage vault or personal verifiable
claim wallet, that stores and protects access to a <a>holder's</a>
credentials and verifiable claims.</dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="creators">creator</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The <a>identity profile</a> that is associated with creating a particular resource.
For example, the key that created a <a>digital signature</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential|credentials">credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of claims that refer to a qualification, achievement, personal quality,
aspect of an <a>identity profile</a> such as a name, government ID, preferred payment
processor, home address, or university degree typically used to indicate
suitability.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential services">credential service</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a <a>credential</a> storage vault or personal
credential wallet, that stores and protects access to a
<a>recipient's</a> credentials.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="CTP">credential transport protocol</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of messages and protocols for issuing, storing, requesting, and
transmitting <a>credentials</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential validation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process that demonstrates the information in a <a>credential</a> is well-formed.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential verification</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process that cryptographically demonstrates the authenticity of a <a>credential</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A portable URI-based identifier, also known as a DID, that is associated with
an <a>entity</a>. These
identifiers are most often used in a <a>credential</a> and are associated
with <a>recipients</a> such that the <a>credential</a> itself can be easily
ported from one <a>identity provider</a> to another without the need to
reissue the <a>credential</a>. An example of a DID is:
<code>did:b6922d8e-20df-4939-95cd-f79375979178</code>
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifier documents|DID document|DID documents">decentralized identifier document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A document that is accessible via the <a>WebDHT</a> and contains information
related to a particular <a>decentralized identifier</a> such as the
associated <a>identity provider</a> and public key information.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>digital signature</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entities|entity's">entity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A thing with distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization,
concept, or device.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="holders|holder's|recipient|recipients|recipient's">holder</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that is in control of a particular <a>credential</a>.
Typically a holder's identity is also the primary subject of the information
in a credential. A holder is often the <a>entity</a> that initiates the
transmission of a credential.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity profiles|identity profile's">identity profile</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of information that can be used to identify a particular
<a>entity</a> such as a person, organization, concept, or device. An
<a>entity</a> may have multiple identity profiles.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity documents">identity document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A Web-based document that contains statements about a
particular <a>identity profile</a>. Identity documents MUST be accessible in
JSON-LD format and MAY be accessible in other RDF-compatible formats.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity owner's">identity owner</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that is in control of a particular <a>identity document</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity provider's|IdP|IdP's">identity provider</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A software service that manages one or more <a>identity profiles</a> and their
associated <a>credentials</a> on behalf of an <a>entity</a>. It typically
handles requests to store <a>credentials</a> issued by an
<a>issuer</a> and to retrieve <a>credentials</a> when requested by a
<a>credential inspector</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential inspector|credential inspectors|credential inspector's|inspector's|inspectors">inspector</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that requests a <a>credential</a> and then evalutates it.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="issuers|issuer's">issuer</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that creates a <a>credential</a> and associates it
with a particular <a>subject</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="subject's|subjects">subject</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The <a>entity</a> about which a <a>claim</a> is made.  Note that this is not necessarily the same
  as the <a>holder</a> of a claim.  The subject of a claim might be a pet who has gotten vaccinated.
  The holder of that claim is likely the pet's owner, not the pet.</dd>
  <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between <a>holders</a>, <a>issuers</a> and
<a>credential inspectors</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>WebDHT</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A mechanism that is used to discover the software services, such as an
<a>identity provider</a>, associated with an <a>entity</a>.
Technically speaking, it is a Web-based decentralized hashtable built on Web
architecture principles that is used to map cryptographic hashes to
<a>decentralized identifiers</a> and <a>decentralized identifiers</a> to
<a>decentralized identifier documents</a>. The technology is used to map
cryptographic hashes of email addresses and passphrases to
<a>decentralized identifier documents</a> which can then be used to discover
an <a>entity's</a> <a>identity provider</a>. The technology is one way of
solving the
