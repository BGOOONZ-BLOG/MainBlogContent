## How to contribute

Editing files works like a Wiki.

Browse to the file using the [Github Page][GHPage] and click on the "Edit" button of the page. This will open the Github detail page of that file where you can start editing, if you are logged in.

We use the standard [Markdown syntax][MarkdownSyntax].

If you get the following note, don't panic:

> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.

It is technical for "Don't worry, make your edits, we will make sure they are considered!""

Donâ€™t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Click the "Propose this change" button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click "Send pull request" the editor will be notified of your proposal and may adopt it.

Note that the changes are not immediately reflected on any page. If you want to see your changes there is a "Preview" button.
