This is currently a stub, to produce [an implementation report for HTML 5.3](http://w3c.github.io/test-results/html53/implementation-report.html)
as [required to move a Candidate recommendation to a Proposed Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#rec-pr).

This document is unlikely to be maintained once HTML 5.3 is released as a W3C Recommendation.
