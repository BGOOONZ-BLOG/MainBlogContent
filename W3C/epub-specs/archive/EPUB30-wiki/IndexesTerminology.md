# Indexes terminology (draft) #

This is a working list of terms/definitions.  This is not a comprehensive list of all terms related to indexes/indexing (see the [Charter Proposal Definitions](IndexesCharterProposal#Definitions.md) for that) but rather a narrower list with more refined definitions, as they evolve in our work.



## cross reference ##

A cross reference refers from one entry to another entry. May be generic or specific.

## cross reference list ##

One or more cross references associated with the term of an entry.

## decoration ##

Separate character or string that serves as a modifier on the locator, or different formatting that serves as a modifier of the locator.  May be hard-coded into the text, or generated using CSS based on locator target type (e.g., figure, chart, statute, etc.)

## editorial note ##

A "paragraph" following a term that is an informative note about the meaning or usage of this term. It looks like a child entry but actually is attached to the term. Usually there are no locators attached to a term with an editorial note but there are child terms.

## entry ##

A term and any locator list, any cross reference list, any editor's note, and/or any entries that are child entries to this parent entry. A term cannot stand alone as an entry; there must be at least one locator, cross reference, editor's note, or child entry.

## generic-term cross-reference ##

A see or see also cross-reference that refers to a category or class of entries, for example, "See specific flower names" or "See individual states".

## group ##

A set of main entries, for example all entries beginning with "A" or that share some other common characteristic. It may include a group heading.

## group navigation data ##

A string of hyperlinked letters and/or digits (e.g., A-Z, 0-9) used to easily navigate to a group of entries in the index: for example, clicking P would take the user to the section of the index beginning with P. Other alphabets and character systems would display the appropriate glyphs for any navigation data. In large indexes, group data might be 'A-Am', 'An-Az', ... or in small indexes, 'A-G', 'H-L', 'M-O', ...

## head notes ##

Optional miscellaneous content appearing at the top of an index: title, explanation of usage, format of locators, coverage of information, etc.

## index ##

Optional index head + optional group navigation data + index body

## index body ##

The portion of the index that contains all the groups.

## index head ##

The portion of the index that contains any informational front matter: title, legend, head notes, alphabetical order examples, etc.  In a chapter-like index it usually precedes the index body.

## legend ##

A list of abbreviations or indicators used in the index and their meaning. These could explain prefixes to locators, flags on headings, decorations.

## locator ##

Consists of two parts: (1) actionable character string or image (2) URI.  It can also have an optional (3) target type, to indicate whether a locator points to a figure, a table, a federal statute, and so on.

## locator list ##

One or more locators associated with the term of an entry.

## main entry ##

An entry with no parent.

## see also cross-reference ##

Directs the user to a different location in the index where there is additional relevant information

## see cross-reference ##

Directs the user to the preferred (correct) term in an index

## specific-term cross-reference ##

A see or see also cross-reference that refers to one or more specific entries, for example "See Smith; Jones; Jackson"

## target ##

The piece of content that is pointed to by the locator. It can be either a single point or a range of text.

## term ##

Character string, representing the indexable item -- e.g., a name, place, concept, topic, or any one of an almost infinite number of things
