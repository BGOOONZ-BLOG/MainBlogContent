### Draft Agenda

* Charter

* [Sanitizer API](https://wicg.github.io/sanitizer-api/): There's an ongoing set of discussions around this API, both in its shape and in its [integration with Trusted Types](https://github.com/WICG/sanitizer-api/pull/55).

* [COEP: Credentialless](https://github.com/mikewest/credentiallessness/): There's good discussion going on in [the TAG review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/582), and it's worth reviewing the proposal in this forum.
