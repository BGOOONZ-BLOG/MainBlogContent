<p>The following guidelines cover how to write Shell prompts on MDN pages.</p>
<h2 id="shell-prompts-in-brief">Shell prompts in brief</h2>
<p>A shell is a program that waits for you to type in a command and then press the return key. To indicate which commands you should type, MDN documentation lists them in a code block, similar to code examples. Such a block looks like this:</p>
<p><code>bash example-good # This may take a while... hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/ firefox cd firefox</code></p>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
<p>There are a some guidelines to follow when writing a shell code block:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not include a “$” or “&gt;” at the beginning of a shell instruction. It confuses more than it helps and it is not useful when copying the instructions.</li>
<li>Comments start with “#”.</li>
<li>Choose the “Bash” syntax highlighter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django">Django server-side development docs</a> show good practice presentation of shell prompt commands, etc. on MDN. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment">Setting up a Django development environment</a> for example.</p>
