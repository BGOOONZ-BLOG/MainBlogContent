<section id="goals">
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The Web Authentication Working Group will develop recommendation-track specifications defining  an API, as well as signature and attestation formats which provide an asymmetric cryptography-based foundation for  authentication of users to Web Applications.</p><p>

Overall goals include obviating the use of shared secrets, i.e. passwords, as authentication credentials, facilitating multi-factor authentication support as well as hardware-based key storage while respecting the Same Origin Policy.
</p>

</section>
      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
The Working Group will determine use cases that the API needs to support and use these to derive requirements. Success will be determined by the implementation of API features as defined in this section of the charter.
</p><p>
API Features in scope are: 
 (1) Requesting generation of an asymmetric key pair within a specific scope (e.g., an origin); (2) Proving that the browser has possession of a specific private key, where the proof can only be done within the scope of the key pair.
</p><p>
Dependencies exist on the <a href='https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-credential-management/'>Credential Management API</a> in the <a href='https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/'>W3C Web Application Security Working Group</a>.
</p><p>
Note that the details of any user experience (such as prompts) will not be normatively specified, although they may be informatively specified for certain function calls.
</p><p>
The Web Authentication Working Group should aim to produce specifications that have wide deployment and should adopt, refine and when needed, extend, existing practices and community-driven draft specifications when possible. The APIs should integrate well with Web Applications and so should be developed in concert with Web Application developers and reviewed by the <a href='https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/'>Web Application Security</a> and <a href='https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/'>Web Platform</a> Working Groups.
</p><p>
Comprehensive test suites should be developed for the specification to ensure interoperability. User-centric privacy considerations of device management and credentials should be taken into account. The Working Group may produce protocol standards as needed by the API.

          Deliverables
        </h2>

        <p>The group will aim to produce FPWDs of its normative deliverables in <b>Q1 2016</b>, and send them to <b>CR by December 2016</b>. More detailed milestones and updated publication schedules will be available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Security/web-authentication/pubstatus.html">group publication status page</a>.</p>


        <div id="normative">
          <h3>
            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
<p>
The working group will deliver at least the following:

<dl><dt>Web Authentication API</dt>

<dd>This specification will make secure authentication available to Web application developers via a standardized API providing the operations detailed in the scope section. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2015/SUBM-fido-web-api-20151120/">FIDO 2.0 Web APIs</a> will be an input into this standard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl><dt>Data and signature formats</dt>
<dd>
	Formats for signed data and verifiable attestation of a signer's properties. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2015/SUBM-fido-key-attestation-20151120/">FIDO 2.0 Attestations</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2015/SUBM-fido-signature-format-20151120/">FIDO 2.0 Signature Format</a> will be inputs into this standard.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The specifications must contain a section detailing any known security implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users. The Web Authentication WG will actively seek an open security review.
</p><p>
The specifications should take advantage of existing platform and operating-system authentication libraries as appropriate.

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working Groups, and with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Security/web-authentication.html">Web Authentication Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>        
        <p>
          Most Web Authentication Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work through a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn">GitHub repository</a> and on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-webauthn@w3.org">public-webauthn@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webauthn/">archive</a>). The public is invited to raise github issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#def-Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>.
