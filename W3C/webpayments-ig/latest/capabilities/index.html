Payments and the ability to exchange value efficiently and securely over
the web are critical to global commerce. Open standards for payments and
value exchange help ensure open access and interoperability to financial
systems for all the people that use the Web. This document describes
a set of capabilities and key top-level architectrual principles that, if standardized, will improve payments on the
Web.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="sotd">
  <p>
This document is in early draft state and is expected to rapidly evolve
based on broad feedback and input from the Web Payments Interest Group.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<section>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In October of 2014, the W3C  <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/04/payments/webpayments_charter.html">chartered</a> the Web Payments Interest group with the goal of providing a forum for Web Payments technical discussions to identify use cases and requirements for existing and/or new specifications to ease payments on the Web, and to establish a common ground for organizations providing payment services on the Web Platform. The overall objective of this group is to identify and help create the conditions for greater uptake and wider use of Web Payments through the identification of standardization needs to increase interoperability between the different stakeholders and the different payment methods. </p>

<p>
The Web Payments Interest Group's scope covers payment transactions using Web technologies on all computer devices (desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet, etc.) running a Web user-agent (a Web browser, a hybrid app, or an installed Web application) and using all possible legal payments methods across a variety of scenarios including Web-mediated Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Business to Consumer (B2B2C), and Person-to-Person (P2P) transactions in the case of physical (payment at physical shops) and online payments for physical or digital goods, including in-app payments. </p>

<p>
Due to the fundamental importance of payments to the web and the intricate relationship with other core aspects of the open web platform such as identity and commerce, the Web Payments IG created this document with the following goals in mind:
<ul>
<li>Provide a common place to capture and document key capabilities that are necessary for payments on the web</li>
<li>Communcate important architectural principles related to payments on the web and how they relate to other standards such as identity and commerce</li>
<li>Increasing visibility and improving coordination of various payments and related standardization efforts within the W3C Interest, Working, and Community groups and other standards bodies</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Audience of this document</h2>
<p>
This document is intended to broadly inform discussions on standardization of key capabilities and high level architecture of payments on the web. The intended audience for this document includes:
	<ul>
	    <li>Participants in W3C Activities</li>
	    <li>Other groups and individuals designing technologies to be integrated into the Web</li>
	    <li>Implementers of W3C specifications</li>
	    <li>Web content authors and publishers</li>
	</ul>

<section>
<h1>Capability Domains</h1>
<p>
	In order to illustrate core aspects of payments on the web, this section of the document is organized by functional capability domains.  This is intended to help highlight specific areas that are needed for standardization of payments, and also to help communicate relationships and dependencies to adjacent standards work such as Identity and Commercial aspects of the web.
</p>
The capabilities have been organized into course grained domains which were structured to help promote consistent and cohesive concepts in similar functional aspects, reduce coupling between core payments standards and those which are useful more broadly than payments, and to minimize redundant or overlapping work being done on standards in this space by providing visbility into cross cutting concerns and topics across each functional domain.

<p>
Each capability includes backgound context specific to its domain, key goals and architecural principles related to the capability and outlines significant relationships with other standards work and capability domains.  The five top level capability domains are represented in the diagram below:

      <strong>Capabilities</strong>: Key Creation and Management,
Cryptographic Signatures, Encryption
    </div>
    <div class="issue">
Right now this group has only security capabilities in it. We may
wish to have a more general purpose Core set. If so, what would this
core set include?
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Identity and Credentials</h3>
	Includes features related to
establishing trust among parties, and credentialing or authorization
of parties involved in a transaction.
    <div class='group-capability'>
      <strong>Capabilities</strong>: Identity, Credentials, Rights,
Authentication, Authorization, Privacy, Discovery, Registration,
Enrollment, and Legal/Regulatory concerns.
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Accounts and Ownership</h3>
	Includes capabilities
related to managing stores of value (such as Deposit Accounts) and
recorded accounts of ownership (such as Ledger entries, Deeds, etc.)
used as part of the settlement of payments or commercial exchanges.
Settlement via the Web involves access to the accounts of the
participants and ledgers of the <a title="account provider">account
providers</a> and capabilities to manage accounts and capture and
monitor transactions in a ledger against those accounts.<br>
    <div class='group-capability'>
      <strong>Capabilities</strong>: Accounts, Account Management and Legal/Regulatory concerns related to accounts and recorded ownership
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>

    <h3>Clearing and Settlement</h3> These are the capabilities
that help parties in a transaction establish the mechanics of how the
payment will be executed and the directly or indirectly make this
happen. This involves the ability to discover and negotiate the
mechanism that will be used to execute the payment and agree on the
terms including facts such as the costs of making the payment, time
between clearing of the payment and settlement into the payee's
account, regulatory requirements and required authorisations.
    <div class='group-capability'>
      <strong>Capabilities</strong>: Messaging, Clearing, Markets, Foreign/Currency Exchange, and Legal/regulatory concerns specific to payment clearing, settlement and Exchange of Value.

<section>
	<h2>Key Principles</section>

</section>

<section>
<h1>Capabilities in Context</h1>
    <div class="issue">
		We will be overhauling this section to move into Key principles section and simplify the intent of the interaction wheel - namely the key principle that activities related to payments and adjacent domains may take place asynchronously over an extended time horizon and that required standards may be best expressed as a discrete interactions between 2 parties which can be recombined to express larger payments "flows" or multi-step scenarios.
    </div>
<p>
To simplify and harmonize the descriptions of capabilities necessary for
payments and value exchange on the Web, it is helpful to understand the
parties involved and the direction that information flows among them at
various <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/#an-overview-of-the-payment-phases">
phases</a> of a payment. We use the following diagram to help illustrate
roles and information flow:
</p>
<p>
  <span><img alt="InteractionsWheel.png" src="images/image00.png" title=
  ""></span>
</p>
<p>
Figure: Payment Interaction Wheel
</p>
<p>
For example, the following diagrams illustrate three interactions in a
comment payment scenario.
</p>
<p>
  <span><img alt="Request for Payment.png" src="images/image03.png" title=
  ""></span>
</p>
<p>
Interaction 1:
</p>
<p><a>Payee</a> communicates request for payment to <a>payer</a> and shares
payment instructions
</p>
<p>
  <span><img alt="Payer-PayeeService Provider.png" src=
  "images/image02.png" title=""></span>
</p>
<p>
Interaction 2:
</p>
<p><a>Payer</a> uses information received from <a>Payee</a> and creates a
new payment request from <a>payment service provider</a> with stored
value.
</p>
<p>
  <span><img alt="PSPtoPSP.png" src="images/image04.png" title=""></span>
</p>
<p>
Interaction 3:
</p>
<p>
  <a title="payer">Payer's</a> <a>payment service provider</a> sends
details to complete payment to <a title='payee'>Payee's</a> <a>payment
service provider</a>
</p>
<p>
The roles illustrated here may be carried out by many different
entities. For example, "<a>account provider</a>" may be carried out by
financial institutions, mobile operators, tech companies, or
cryptocurrency systems; '<a>payee</a>' may be an individual, a business,
an NGO, or any entity that can accept a payment.
</p>
<p>
A payment may involve just two parties (e.g., peer-to-peer) or may be
carried out by several collaborating parties. For instance, a<a>payee</a> may use a payment service provider which in turn uses a
card network. The actions of these intermediaries may vary, from simply
forwarding messages to fulfilling regulatory obligations. Additionally,
these interactions may happen in different sequences and direction
depending on the payment context.

<h2>Identity and Credentials</h2>

<p>
The word <em>identity</em> means different things to different people
and is often discussed as a problem waiting to be solved on the Web. In
the physical world, we have many identities. We have an identity for
work life and home life. We have an identity that we use when we talk
with our friends and one that we use when we talk with our families. The
concept of identity is as nuanced as it is broad.
</p>

<p>
There are aspects of our identities that have very little consequence
to others, such as whether we have dark brown hair or black hair. There
are also aspects of our identities that are vital for proving that we
should be able to perform certain tasks, like a drivers license or
a medical board certification. Then there are aspects of our identities
that are important for social reasons, such as the rapport that we build
with our friends over our lifetimes.
</p>

<p>
Many aspects of our identity are often expressed via
<em>credentials</em>, which can be seen as verifiable statements made by
one person or organization about another. There have been multiple
attempts at formalizing credentials on the Web; each one of them have
been met with varying degrees of mild success, but mostly failure. The
rest of this section focuses on the goals of a healthy identity and
credentialing ecosystem as well as capabilities that would enable such
and ecosystem to thrive.
</p>

<section>
  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>A healthy credentialing ecosystem should have a number of
  qualities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li id="goal-interoperable">Credentials should be
    <strong>interoperable and portable</strong>. Credentials should be
    used by as broad of a range of organizations as possible. The
    recipient of a credential should be able to store, manage, and share
    credentials throughout their lifetime with relative ease.</li>

    <li id="goal-scalable">The ecosystem <strong>should scale to the 3
    billion people</strong> using the Web today and then to the 6 billion
    people that will be using the Web by the year 2020.</li>

    <li id="goal-privacy">The process of exchanging a credential should be
    <strong>privacy enhancing</strong> and <strong>recipient
    controlled</strong> such that the system protects the privacy of the
    individual or organization using the credential by placing the
    recipient in control of who is allowed to access their
    credential.</li>

    <li id="goal-implementation-ease">Implementing systems that issue and
    consume credentials should be <strong>easy for Web developers</strong>
    in order to lower barriers to entry and increase the amount of
    software solutions in the ecosystem.</li>

    <li id="goal-accessible">Creating systems that are
    <strong>accessible</strong> should be a fundamental design criteria,
    as 10% of the worldÃ¢â¬â¢s population have disabilities and the solution
    should be usable by as many people as possible.</li>

    <li id="goal-open">The solution should follow a number of core Web
    principles such as being <strong>patent and royalty-free</strong>,
    adhering to Web architecture fundamentals, supporting <strong>network
    and device independence</strong>, and being
    <strong>machine-readable</strong> where possible to <strong>enable
    automation</strong> and engagement of non-human actors.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Capabilities</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
Identity
    <ol>
      <li>
Entities in the System are able to access Identity information
of other parties it is interacting with if specifically required by
law, or if consented to by owner of the information
      </li>
      <li>
Identity and credentials of an entity are able to be
linked/associated with Accounts and payments to satisfy requirements
for <a title="account provider">Account Providers</a> and
<a title="payment service provider">Payments Service Providers</a>
to comply with KYC/AML requirements.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
Credentials
    <ol>
      <li>
Entities in the system are able to be associated with 1 or more
credentials. A credential is a qualification, achievement, quality,
or piece of information about an entity's background such as a name,
home address, government ID, professional license, or university
degree, typically used to indicate suitability. This allows for the
exchange of suitable qualities of the entity (ex. over age 21)
without divulging sensitive attributes/details about the entity (ex.
date of birth)
      </li>
      <li>
<a>Payer</a> is able to exchange standard format credentials with<a>Payee</a>
to validate attributes necessary to complete the payment
      </li>
      <li>
Entities in the system may store a credential at an arbitrary identity
provider after it has been issued by an arbitrary issuer. This helps create a
level playing field for all actors in the ecosystem.
      </li>
      <li>
A protocol for migrating from one identity provider to another without
the need to reissue each credential. This promotes a healthy identity
provider ecosystem.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
Data Model
<ol>
  <li>
The data model should be extensible such that it supports an entity making
an unbounded set of claims about another entity. This enables a very
broad applicability of credentials to different use cases and market verticals.
  </li>
  <li>
The data model should be capable of being expressed in a variety of data
syntaxes. This increases interoperability between disparate credentialing
systems and increases the long-term viability of the technology.
  </li>
  <li>
A formal mechanism of expressing new types of claims without
centralized coordination. This promotes a high degree of parallel
adoption and innovation.
  </li>
</ol>
  </li>
  <li>
Rights
    <ol>
      <li>
An entity should be able to express what "allowable use" of a credential
is when providing it to another entity such that there is recourse if a
credential is misused. For example, when providing an email address credential
an assertion is made such that the email address cannot be used as a
destination for marketing material.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
Authentication
    <ol>
      <li>
Participants are able to authenticate the validity of
identifiers presented by entities that they are interacting with
      </li>
      <li>
A digital signature mechanism that does not require out-of-band information to
verify the authenticity of claims; instead it should enable public
keys to be automatically fetched via the Web during verification. It
should not render the signed data opaque because opaque data is harder
to learn from, program to, and debug. This makes the digital signature
mechanism easier to use for developers and system integrators.
      </li>
      <li>
An issuer should be able to revoke a previously issued credential. This
enables issuers to ensure that the credentials they have issued
accurately represent their claims throughout the lifetime of the credential.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
Authorization
  </li>
    <ol>
      <li>
Entities may use credentials to get access to protected resources or get
approval to perform protected tasks.
      </li>
    </ol>
  <li>
Privacy
    <ol>
      <li>
All capabilities in this document should be standardized in a
way that minimizes the inclusion/exchange of personal or other
sensitive metadata that are part of the payments process unless
specifically required by law, or consented to by the owner of the
information.
      </li>
      <li>
A protocol that enables the recipient to share their credentials without
revealing the intended destination to their identity provider. This
enhances privacy.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
Discovery
    <ol>
      <li>
<a>Payer</a> is able to securely locate public identifier of<a>Payee</a> to be used as part of payment process
      </li>
      <li>
<a>Payee</a> is able to obtain public identifier of <a>Payer</a>
participating in payment process
      </li>
      <li>
<a>Payer</a> identifier is persistent across devices
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
Registration

would violate personally identifiable information regulations. For example,
collecting the name and home address of a minor should be detectable and
avoided in jurisdictions where that is not allowed.

      <li>
Entities should be able to easily request credentials and prove that they
performed the required regulatory checks before allowing a transaction

<h1>Guiding principles and key considerations</h1>
<p>
Due to the breadth of the capabilities that will require
standardization, it is important to outline certain guiding principles
which are expected to be incorporated across each of the defined
capabilities in this document as they are undertaken by standards teams.
The principles include:
</p>
<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
Because the Web payments architecture will accommodate a great
variety of payment schemes (existing and new), we expect to future
standards to support interoperability on a minimal set of features and
also support scheme-specific extensions. Therefore, data formats must be
easily extensible.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Composability</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
Different parties will want to add information to messages that are
forwarded.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Identifiers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
Payment schemes define identifier syntax and semantics (e.g.,
primary account numbers (PANs) for credit cards, or bitcoin account
identifiers). We expect to support scheme-specific identifiers. But
where global identifiers are required and are not scheme specific, we
expect to use URIs.
  </li>
  <li>
Due to the nature of payments and the fundamental challenge of
preventing 'double-spending' as part of the payments process, it is
important that every actor/system be uniquely identifiable to other
actors and systems participating in the payments process. While each
actor must be identifiable, a number of use cases that need to be
addressed include low value or less-sensitive payments which do not
require the knowledge of a participant's identity as a part of the
transaction. Because of this, it is important to de-couple the
identification (non-identity based unique ID) of each participant in the
Architecture from the Identity data (sensitive/private data about the
participant) which describes information about a participant taking part
in the system
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
Messages must not be altered in transit, but may be included as part
of encapsulating messages created by intermediaries.
  </li>
  <li>
It must be possible to provide read-only access to transaction
information to third parties (with user consent).
  </li>
  <li>
Signatures must be non-forgeable.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Identity, Privacy, and Consumer Protection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
To satisfy regulatory requirements and financial industry
expectations, some use cases will require strong assurances of
connections between a Web identity and a real-world identity.
  </li>
  <li>
At the same time, any source of information that can lead to the
unintended disclosure or leakage of a user's identity (or purchasing
habits) is likely protected in a jurisdiction somewhere in the world by
a legal/regulatory entity having responsibility for its citizens.
  </li>
  <li>
For discussion: the role of per-transaction pseudo-anonymous
identity mechanisms for some use cases. These mechanisms would make it
much more difficult for an unauthorized party to track a user's
purchasing habits from 1 transaction to another transaction. This will
also eliminate the loss of that identity from affecting other services
that user is enrolled in.
  </li>
  <li>
Regulations in several jurisdictions require the consumer to be
notified every time their personal information/credentials are accessed.
To discuss: cryptography requiring a user's input/knowledge to open that
information.
  </li>
  <li>
Some purchases in combination (e.g., products accommodating prenatal
care needs) will leak sensitive information. To discuss: dynamic key
construction can be applied to each line item in a receipt to help
prevent unauthorized data mining of individuals, legal &amp; regulatory
snooping. Even if the protected information is stolen or accidentally
forwarded to unauthorized parties they will not have the correct
tokenized inputs to recreate the dynamic keys to unlock access to the
protected information.
  </li>
  <li>
Role based access controls when applied to dynamic key construction
for each individual credential or large sets of data will help
facilitate interoperable access without needless duplication and
encryption of information for each authorized party. For discussion: Use
dynamic keys to protect a static key where various dynamic keys can be
used to unlock the static key that protects the sensitive content.
  </li>
  <li>
The system should support privacy by requiring only the minimal
amount of information necessary to carry out a transaction. Additional
considerations (e.g., marketing initiatives with user consent, or legal
requirements) may lead to additional information exchange beyond the
minimum required.
  </li>
  <li>
Payment account providers must take measures to ensure that account
identifiers are not, on their own, sufficient to identify the account
holder.
  </li>
  <li>
Another suggestion: 'Don't require personal authentication, but make
sure it can be done properly'
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal and Regulatory</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
In some jurisdictions legal or regulatory entities may need to be
granted 'time-limited access' to a transaction to view specific
credentials and purchased items of the user. The system should limit
what is viewed to the minimum necessary. Examples: Government subsidies
such as food stamps, controlled substances. In these cases those
particular line items in the receipt may be required to be viewable via
individuals or computers charged with the responsibility to prevent
abuse of those programs (e.g., unauthorized reselling). There may also
be a requirement to view identities or credentials.
  </li>
  <li>
For certain classes of payments, such as high value or
international, it must be possible to provide role-based access controls
to pierce a pseudo-anonymous identity mechanism so the transaction can
be counter signed by a legal, regulatory, or KYC/AML system yet
safeguard against disclosing unnecessary information. It must be
infeasible for the piercing of this mechanisms to leak enough
information for those authorities to forge user information.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
Web payment schemas, interfaces, data and the architectures that
enable them need to be made accessible for people with disabilities. Web
APIs and applications must be developed and implemented with
accessibility-in-mind and allow for accessibility features. If not,
developers, payees, providers and retailers may be in violation of
disability laws.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Discovery and instrument selection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
Default expectation for privacy reasons is that <a>payee</a> will
present accepted schemes and computation of intersection (or other
compution) will happen on the <a>payer</a> side.
  </li>
  <li>
There are other scenarios to discuss that would presumably involve
user consent (e.g., computation done on <a>payee</a> side, or by a third
party platform).
  </li>
  <li>
Manual card entry will be with us for a while. When there is no
digital wallet, the working group should discuss (and possibly recommend
good practice) for dealing with the case where there is no registered
digital wallet. For example, one idea was for browsers to offer a sort
of "transient digital wallet" that acts within the protocol to handle
manual data entry.
  </li>
  <li>
Quoting Adrian Hope-Bailie idea: 'The algorithm MUST not prevent any
scheme from being available as a candidate for registration AND for this
matching/discovery process. i.e. It shouldn't be possible for the
browser (or any other component that executes this discovery process) to
exclude schemes or instruments on the basis of anything but technical
incompatibility.'
  </li>
  <li>
The standard should not hard-code a selection process. Regulatory
and cultural preferences may vary (e.g., the <span><a href=
  "https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flists.w3.org%2FArchives%2FPublic%2Fpublic-webpayments-ig%2F2015Jun%2F0114.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHM5Sh5w_M5mfM_y-jTtvIgiTNlww">
