    The MPTF is a subset of the Web and TV

    The MPTF is a subset of the Web and TV Interest Group. The
	goal of MPTF is to discuss requirements placed on the HTML5
	video, audio and media interfaces by media formats that are used
	for Web and TV applications.  The MPTF also proposes APIs that
	meet these requirements.
    
    The requirements and use cases in this document are the result
    of discussion within the Media Pipeline Task Force of the Web
    and TV Interest Group.  This document proposes additions to
    the HTML5 specification so that user agents can enable authorized
    access to premium content through
    a standard set of APIs in an interoperable way.
    
    This proposal extends the capability of HTML5's &lt;video&gt;
    and &lt;audio&gt; elements to allow JavaScript to manage
    authorized access to premium
    media streams for playback. The requirements do not limit
    the particular content protection method. Rather they provice a
    standardized API as well as a default content protection method
    to enable both proprietary and open content protection solutions.
    
    The Task Force believes all the requirements and use cases
    listed in this document will be next reviewd and discussed by
    the HTML Working Group for inclusion in the HTML
    specification.

	<section>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A majority of Internet traffic is now streaming video.</p>

		<p>However, there are currently no standards or common conventions
			in HTML to provide the level of content protection required by some
			content owners. As a result, content owners must support multiple,
			non-interoperable private content protection solutions.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Conformance</h2>

		<p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring
			guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
			non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

		<p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT in
			this specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
			[[RFC2119]].</p>

		<p>
			This specification only applies to one class of product:
			<dfn>W3C Technical Reports</dfn>
			. A number of specifications may be created to address the
			requirements enumerated in this document. In some cases the union of
			multiple parts of different specifications may be needed to address a
			single requirement. Nevertheless, this document speaks only of
			<dfn>conforming specifications</dfn>
			.
		</p>

		<p>Conforming specifications are ones that address one or more
			requirements listed in this document. Conforming specifications
			should attempt to address SHOULD level requirements requirements
			unless there is a technically valid reason not to do so.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Terminology</h2>

		<dl>
			<dt>
				<dfn>Adaptive Bit Rate</dfn>
			</dt>
			<dd>Adaptive bit rate media is characterized by short
				independent parallel media stream segments that can be individually
				selected and rendered according to some selective criteria.
				Typically, the parallel segments are differentiated by a feature
				such as required bandwidth, image resolution, etc.</dd>
			<dt>
				<dfn>Content Decryption Module (CDM)</dfn>
			</dt>
			<dd>The Content Decryption Module (CDM) is a generic term for a
				part of or add-on to the user agent that provides functionality for
				one or more Key Systems. Implementations may or may not separate the
				implementations of CDMs and may or may not treat them as separate
				from the user agent. This is transparent to the API and application.
				A user agent may support one or more CDMs.</dd>

		<h2>MPTF Requirements for Content Protection</h2>

		<p>This section list the requirements that conforming
			specification(s) would need to adopt in order to ensure a common
			interface and interpretation for the playback and control of
			protected media. These requirements are the result of an interactive
			process of feedback and discussion within the Media Pipeline Task
			Force of the Web and TV Interest Group</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The Media Pipeline Task Force takes no position on the
					specifics of the legal agreements (referred to hereinafter
					collectively as "the agreement.") between users, content owners and
					content distibution service providers. The objective of the MPTF
					regarding content protection is to identify requirements for the
					technical tools to enable the terms of those agreements.</li>
				<li>The requirements below will not be perfect. There is no
					system that can absolutely guarantee the intended behavior in all
					cases. When perfection cannot be achieved, a reasonable solution
					(as agreed upon by the MPTF) should be adopted.</li>
			</ol>

			<section>
				<h3>General</h3>
				<section>
					<h4>User Rights</h4>
					<h5>Content protection methods must enable the rights of the
						user as specified in the agreement (See item 1 in Backgroud
						section above).</h5>
					<p>The user should not be restricted from accessing content for
						which legal rights have been obtained.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Owner Rights</h4>
					<h5>Content protection methods must protect the rights of the
						content owners as specified in the agreement.</h5>
					<p>The content owners control the legal rights to the content.
						If their rights are not protected, they are less likely to produce
						the high-value content that drives the commercial video business.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Distributor Rights</h4>
					<h5>Content protection methods must protect the rights of the
						distribution service provider as specified in the agreement.</h5>
					<p>Content distributors also have certain rights and
						obligations as specified in the agreement. Content must be
						protected in transit so as not to be intercepted and used without
						authorization.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Container Format</h4>
					<h5>The content protection solution (the standard interface to
						support content protection) must not advantage one specific
						container format over another.</h5>
					<p>Specifically, the choice of container format should not
						prevent the content protection system from operating.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Mandatory Baseline</h4>
					<h5>The content protection solution (the standard interface to
						support content protection) must support at least one mandatory
						method that can be used to enable interoperability between
						different systems.</h5>
					<p>Support for a baseline content protection solution allows at
						least one method for protected content to be distributed and used.
						This method should be unencumbered with IPR.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Browser Independence</h4>
					<h5>The content protection solution (the standard interface
						defined to support content protection) must work with "open
						source" browsers</h5>
					<p>Specifically, the interface defined by the proposed solution
						should be implementable in any browser without requiring any
						privileged information. This scope of this requirement is limited
						to the interface defined in the proposed solution.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>HTML5 Compatibility</h4>
					<h5>Content protection must be useable in HTML5</h5>
					<p>The implementation of content protection must be capable of
						running within an HTML5 environment. This means any browser
						supportive of HTML5 will be able to specify the parameters and use
						the appropriate tags to get the protected content to play back.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Media Elements</h4>
					<h5>(consensus not yet reached) Content protection must be
						useable with specific HTML5 features such as media elements (and
						features (such as timed tracks) within these elements).</h5>
					<p>Timed text tracks and other features of HTML5 media tags
						must work with protected media streams as described in this
						requirements document. The use of any of these features must not
						disable or prevent the use of a compliant implementation of
						protected media.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Encrypted Content</h4>
					<h5>(consensus not yet reached) Media element features that
						are available in an implementation must be available for encrypted
						content as well as unencrypted content.</h5>
					<p>This is the corrolary to the previous requirement. The use
						of any compliant content protection system must not disable or
						prevent the use of any particular media element features.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Common Errors</h4>
					<h5>Specific errors relevant to content protections must be
						identified and reportable.</h5>
					<p>The primary errors must be common across different content
						protection systems so that the unique details of the protection
						method are not required to be known in advance</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Adaptive Bit Rate Media</h4>
					<h5>The content protection solution (the standard interface
						defined to support content protection) must be compatible with
						adaptive bit rate media.</h5>
					<p>The content protection solution must work with adaptive bit
						rate streaming as well as traditional non-adaptive streaming
						methods. This ensures that the content protection systems will
						work with emerging streaming media types.</p>
				</section>

			<h2>Use Cases</h2>


			<p>This section is a non-exhaustive list of use cases that would
				be enabled by one (or more) specifications implementing the
				requirements listed above. Each use case is written according to the

			<section>
				<h3>U1. Support Authorized Access to Content</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt>Description</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This use case is intended to illustrate the protection of
							the rights of users, owners and distributors of digital media
							according to a mutually supported contract. The use case does not
							stipulate the terms of any contract, it just requires the
							specification of features that enable the terms of an anticipated
							contract. For users, this means specification of features that
							can accurately determine a user's rights and the features to
							allow or deny user access to content based on those rights.</p>
						<p>For a content owner, this use case requires the
							specification of features that allow the owner to ensure
							compensation for the use of content owned by the owner according
							to the contract between the owner, distributors and users. For
							the distributor, this use case requires the specification of
							features that enable the secure distribution of content between
							owners and users such that the contract between owners and users
							can be accurately executed and vioation of that contract can be
							prevented.</p>
						<p>Since all systems for providing the protection described
							above are vulnerable and violation of the protections is
							potentially lucrative, the system must be flexible enough to
							evolve to meet changing threats.</p>

						<p>Possible implementation:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The user selects a content item for playback.</li>
							<li>The user's rights to play the content are automatically
								verified.</li>
							<li>Assuming the rights are verified, the content plays.
								Otherwise, the content is prevented from playing.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>Motivation</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>There is no standard interface to verify a user's right to
							access premium content. This leads to the implementation of
							multiple incompatible rights authorization systems and
							interfaces. What should be standardized is:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>an interface to specify the content protection system;</li>
							<li>an interface to allow any content protection system to
								be used to protect content;</li>
							<li>an interface to allow a user to gain legitimate access
								and prevent illegitimate access to content;</li>
							<li>an interface that allows the content protection provider
								to change the system over time to meet evolving threats without
								requiring changes to the interface</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>Dependencies</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In order to obtain access to protected content, the content
							protection system must be identified and proper credentials need
							to be provided.</p>

				<h3>U2. Support for Commonly-used Container Formats</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt>Description</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This use case describes the need for a system that is
							flexible enough to support different implementations of content
							protection. Specifically, it must not unreasonably limit the
							container format to a design that excludes common
							implementations. The system must be flexible enough to multiple
							content protection systems simultaneously. For example, it must
							be capble of playing back programming in one supported protection
							system, then switching to another supported protection system on
							a subsequent piece of programming.</p>

						<p>Possible implementation:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Content that is encrypted is specified for playback.</li>
							<li>The content protection method is applied and the
								decrypted content is played.</li>
							<li>A new encrypted media segment using a different copy
								protection system is selected for playback</li>
							<li>The new content protection method is applied and the
								decrypted content is played</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>Motivation</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>What should be standardized is:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A common interface for specifying the container format
								and protection system</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>Dependencies</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The implementation is dependent upon the the commonality
							between different container formats and a defining a common way
							to specify them.</p>

				<h3>U3. Support for a Baseline CDM</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt>Description</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>This use case describes a baseline CDM (e.g. ClearKey) that
							can be implemented by a user agent in any browser. A baseline CDM
							ensures that there is a way for content to be encoded that allows
							for interoperability between implementations. If a content
							provider encodes content compatible with the baseline CDM, it
							should be playable on any client platform.</p>

						<p>Possible implementation:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A common CDM is defined that can be implemented in open
								source code.</li>
							<li>Content that is expected to run on all platforms must be
								encoded using the common CDM.</li>
							<li>When the content is selected for playback, the common
								CDM is used to decrypt it prior to playback.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>Motivation</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>What should be standardized is:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A common CDM that can be implemented in open source
								code.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>Dependencies</dt>

				<h3>U4. Support for Browser-independent Implementation</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt>Description</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In this use case, the ability to get access to content is
							dependent upon the use of compatible content formats and
							legitimate credentials. These requirements must be
							implementatable by any browser, including and open source
							browser, and the implementation must report common errors.</p>

						<p>Possible implementation:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The user selects copy-protected content for playback.</li>
							<li>The copy protection system requests credentials to
								authorize the playback of the protected content.</li>
							<li>The user provides credetials (or previously provided
								credentials are retrieved) in a way that is common regardless of
								the particular browser platform.</li>
							<li>Once the credentials are verified, the copy protection
								method is applied and the decrypted content is played back.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>Motivation</dt>

				<h3>U5. The player must support playback of Encrypted Adaptive
					Bit-rate Content</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt>Description</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In this use case, a player renders encrypted adaptive
							bit-rate content. The encryption method doesn't limit the ability

							encryption method.</p>

						<p>Possible implementation:</p>
						<ul>
