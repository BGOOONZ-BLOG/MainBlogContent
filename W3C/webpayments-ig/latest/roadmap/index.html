    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
The purpose of this document is to outline a coherent implementation and
deployment strategy for the Web Payments standardization work at W3C. It
consists of the following major sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
<a href="#terminology">Section 2: Terminology</a> defines common terminology
used throughout the document.
      </li>
      <li>
<a href="#coordination">Section 3: Coordination</a> describes the different
groups involved in the work and how they will coordinate to achieve the
long-term vision [[WEB-PAYMENTS-VISION]] of the Web Payments work.
      </li>
      <li>
<a href="#web-payments-phase-1">Section 4: Web Payments Phase 1</a> is
separated into subsections detailing: 1) Strategic goals for the phase,
2) Use cases that should be achievable by the end of the phase, 3)
Capabilities that are targeted and which groups are responsible for
delivering the capabilities, 4) A list of relevant groups that will participate
in the phase as well as what they will be working on during the phase, and
4) Deployment goals and strategies to achieve adoption.

      <h2>Relationship to Other Documents</h2>
      <p>
This document is one part of a greater body of work around Web Payments that
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a>
at W3C is producing. These other documents include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/Vision">A Vision for Web Payments</a>
describes the desirable properties of a Web Payments architecture.
        </li>

        <li>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Web Payments Use Cases
1.0</a> is a prioritized list of all Web Payments scenarios
that the Web Payments Interest Group expects the architecture to address
in time.
        </li>

        <li>
<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webpayments/raw-file/default/latest/capabilities/index.html">
Web Payments Capabilities 1.0</a>
derives a set of capabilities from the use cases that, if standardized, will
improve payments  on the Web.
        </li>

        <li>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/Roadmap">Web Payments Roadmap 1.0</a>
(this document) proposes an implementation and deployment plan that will result
in enhancements to the Open Web Platform that will achieve the scenarios
outlined in the Use Cases document and the capabilities listed in the
Capabilities document.

    <h2>Coordination</h2>

    <p>
In order for the Web Payments Activity to succeed, multiple groups will need
to coordinate work in key areas related to payments, commerce,
identity/credentials, and security. The diagram below outlines the categories
that each group will participate in as well as the phases the groups will
be active in:

    <h2>Web Payments Phase 1</h2>

    <p>
The initial implementation of the Web Payments work will start in October 2015
and will focus on delivering standards for a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP)
by December 2017.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
       <p>The scope of work supports the following elements of a basic purchase
      triggered by user interaction with a Web application initiating a new
      payment. These standards define a high-level message flow for a payment
      from payer to payee either in the form of a credit push (payer
      initiated) or a debit pull (payee initiated) payment, and can be used to
      facilitate a payment from any payment scheme.</p>

      <dl style="margin-top: 5em;">
        <dt>Pre-Payment</dt>

        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Registration</strong>, by the <a>payer</a> with their
            <a>wallet</a>, of any conforming <a>payment
            instrument</a> they wish to use on the Web (e.g. a credit or
            debit card, electronic cash, cryptocurrency, etc).</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Negotiation of Terms</dt>

        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment Initiation Request</strong>, by the payee to
            the payer providing the terms of the payment including elements
            such as the accepted payment schemes, price, currency, recurrence,
            transaction type (purchase, refund etc.), timeout and requests for
            any additional data that is required from the payee.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</dt>

        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Discovery</strong>, by the payer, of their available
            payment instruments that can be used to make the payment. This is
            done by matching those registered by the payer with those
            supported by the payee (as defined in the Payment Initiation
            Request), while keeping information local to the payer.</li>

            <li><strong>Selection of a payment instrument</strong> by the
            payer, confirmation of the terms, and sending of any requested
            data back to the payee for validation.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Execution of the payment by either payer or payee.</li>

            <li>Delivery of a <strong>Payment Completion</strong> generated by
            the entity that executed the payment. This may contain a
            <strong>Proof of Payment</strong> if supported by the payment
            scheme.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The group will also address exceptions that may occur during these
      steps, including payment authorization failure.</p>

      <h3>Deployment and Adoption</h3>
      <p>
Deployment in phase 1 will focus on enabling a few major online retailers
to run Web Payment agents to issue Web Payment invoices for processing at
1-2 major online Payment Service Providers (or banks). The payment
institutions would then initiate the payment and send a proof of payment
back to the retailer.

        <h4>Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
3 major online retailers launching Web Payments support (for example:
Alibaba, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Overstock.com, Amazon, Tesco, eBay, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
1-2 large online payment companies (or banks) launching Web Payments support
(for example: Google Wallet, PayPal, Alipay, Bank of America, HSBC,
US Fed, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
5-10 smaller players from the online retail space and the payments space
            </li>
            <li>
1 million payments within the first year after standardization
            </li>
            <li>
Favorable reviews by the Web developer community
            </li>

        <h4>Strategies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Deployment strategy should be a pure software deployment. Do not require new hardware to be deployed.
          </li>
          <li>
Specifications should focus on technology that has already been prototyped.
          </li>
          <li>
All software should be cloud-only for phase 1. For example, do not try to
support both cloud and local wallets due to a possible conflict around the
"payment message bus" being implemented at the OS layer or the browser layer.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Unresolved Issues</h3>
      <p class="issue">
Where we need an extensible message format, we will want to specify at least
a data model. The hard question will be whether we can achieve a single
serialization (e.g., JSON or JSON-LD or XML) or whether we need multiple.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
What canonicalization (if any) is needed in our messages for the purpose of
digital signatures.
