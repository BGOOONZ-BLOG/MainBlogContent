Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of three Web Annotation WG documents as Proposed Recommendations. The publication date is the 17th of January, 2017 (I make this request early on due to upcoming trips). The transition request for PR has been issued in:

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2016OctDec/0143.html

the Director's approval is in:

	https://www.w3.org/2017/01/06-annopr-minutes.html#resolution01

The documents are as follows
----------------------------

Web Annotation Data Model
http://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-annotation-model-20170117/

Web Annotation Vocabulary
http://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-annotation-vocab-20170117/

Web Annotation Protocol
http://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-annotation-protocol-20170117/

Abstract and Status Sections
----------------------------

See the previous URL-s

I plan to put the documents in place on the 10th of January, i.e., next week Tuesday, and check them with specberus. I will notify you then if I hit any problems.

However, based on earlier experiences, I know that the link checker has a number of problems with the Web Annotation Vocabulary document, but, those are problems with the checker and not the document itself. Indeed, there are a number of errors reported on RDF term URL-s, in the RDF, RDF Schema, or Activity Stream namespaces. Those are valid RDF URI-s, although they are not dereferencable (they are not part of HTML document), which messes up the link checker. These namespaces are:

http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns
http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema

There are also a number of error reports related to http://purl.org/dc/; these are all dereferencable when done via a browser.

Thanks!

Ivan
