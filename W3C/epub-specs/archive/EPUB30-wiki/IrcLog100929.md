For F2F: As much implementation proposals as possible

[mikeidpf](mikeidpf.md) EPUB 2.1 WG e-mail archives http://groups.google.com/group/epub-21-working-group

Chairs: push for proposals

known risk: no implementation proposal = not in spec

Sub group reports

Annotations: Daniel Weck. Few contribs, Will and Daniel. Some proposals, no proofs-of concept. doing good.

Daniel Weck: Some overlap with metadata

EGLS: no update

Metadata: Bill: moving forward, proposals being developed. Prep for F2F looking good

Navigation: George: not a lot of progress. Issue re: alt nav/paging

Peter: if content creators not publishing it (paged  breaks) not a huge issue to concern us

George: concern: referencing P vs. E. Two sets of page #'s.

Subsetting

Prev version expressed subset, where are we going next

Styling/Layout: Brady: some items posted to wiki

Rich Media: Peter: Sent email for implementation proposals

Many requirements

If no proposals will have to wait for next rev

Scripting issues: postponed 1 week

OCF: Superceded/deprecated specs referenced from OCF

upgradng or new/and or sibling specs for OCF 3

James Pritchett: reviewing OCF spec refs, not adding new functions so bringing OCF 3 "up-to-code" not overly problematic

Encryption XML: Used by reading systems

Metadata or Signatures.xml?

Brady: email to list Req 1.5 use cases

re: use cases - font size changes & 'night mode'

Brady & Peter: discussion re: relative fonts sizes

QUIT: [keith\_fahlgren](keith_fahlgren.md) [2010/09/29 23:56:54]

Peter: relation between font size (em) and viewport

Brady: pixels vs em's (cites browser implementations)

Night Mode: What level of control does author have?

Reading systems implement night mode, not documents.

How would night mode styling be declared by author?

QUIT: [James\_Pritchett](James_Pritchett.md) [2010/09/30 00:04:19]

Some reliance on stylesheets, some styling countermands night mode styling (light-on-dark)

Peter: doesn't matter how 'night mode' implemented' only that it is.

Peter: 'negotiation' needed between content and rendering engine. How can video be in night mode?

Action Item: Brady to concoct more use cases
