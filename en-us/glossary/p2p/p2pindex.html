<p>P2P (Peer-to-peer) is a computer networking architecture in which all participating nodes (<em>peers</em>) have equal privileges and share the workload. P2P differs from a client-server network architecture, where multiple <em>client</em> nodes connect to centralized <em>servers</em> for services. P2P is commonly found in Blockchain Applications.</p>
