Accept [previous minutes](MeetingMinutes100804.md)?

## Previous action item review ##

  * Keith: Can ARIA help provide a model for UAs that cannot support chapter-scripted content (perhaps fallbacks, etc).

## Solution Proposals  - process outline ##

_With the caveat that requirements are yet not finalized; until [August 27](Timeline#August_27:_Subgroup_requirements:_finalization.md) subgroup work on solutions are provisional_

  * based on prioritization, subgroup coordinator sets up the working order and allots tasks to group members
  * use wiki to add the proposals, linking to the requirement(s) the proposal addresses, also link to the proposal from the relevant reqs (= bidirectional).
  * for now, keep proposal texts short and to the point, eventually however, more extensive text and details is likely to be requested
  * add your name to the proposal (see "request more extensive text" above).
  * note: competing proposals that address the same requirement may occur; coordinator should elevate decision to whole WG
  * note: first draft deadline for feature inclusion is [October 8](Timeline#October_8:_Subgroup_implementation_proposals_for_first_draft:_fi.md)

## Subgroup status report ##
Sub-group coordinators should:
  * Assure that all requirements are prioritized according to the [Conboy scheme](Process#Prioritization_scheme.md), then notify WG
  * Link in subgroup wiki to any requirements from other subgroups that are co-dependent on a solution of this subgroup
  * Enumerate any requirements that should be given special review attention
  * Enumerate any groups/pairs of requirements that may be in conflict or need to be balanced
  * Raise any issues
  * Present any area for which current requirements seem to be lacking
