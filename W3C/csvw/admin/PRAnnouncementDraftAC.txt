-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,

I am pleased to announce the advancement of the following documents to Proposed Recommendations:

Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/PR-tabular-data-model-20151117/

Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/PR-tabular-metadata-20151117/

Generating RDF from Tabular Data on the Web
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/PR-csv2rdf-20151117/

Generating JSON from Tabular Data on the Web
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/PR-csv2json-20151117/


The approval and publication are in response to this transition request:
   	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2015OctDec/0086.html

The Director has determined the status of the specific normative dependencies as used by the specification are sufficiently stable enough to allow this specification to advance to W3C Proposed Recommendation.

The only substantive change was that the feature marked as "at Risk" in the Candidate Recommendation:

	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-tabular-data-model-20150716/#h-issue1

has been kept as full feature in the document.

Please review the specification and indicate whether you endorse it as a W3C Recommendation or object to its advancement by completing the following WBS survey:

    https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/csvwpr/

The deadline for responses is 23:59, Boston time on 2015-12-15.
