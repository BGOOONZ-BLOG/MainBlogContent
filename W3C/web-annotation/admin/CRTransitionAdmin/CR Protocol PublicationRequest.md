Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of a Web Annotation WG document as Candidate Recommendation. The publication date is the 12th of July, 2016. The transition request for CR has been issued in:
	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2016AprJun/0086.html

the Director's approval is in:
	https://www.w3.org/2016/06/24-wacr-minutes.html

which had a small caveat, namely that a pending issue should be settle with the Tag. The original TAG issue
	https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/93

has been transferred to the WA Issue list:
	https://github.com/w3c/web-annotation/issues/313

The issue is now closed, and the Director has given his remaining approval for publication:
	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-comm/2016Jul/0105.html


The document is as follows
--------------------------

Web Annotation Protocol
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-protocol-20160712/

Abstract and Status Section
---------------------------

See the previous URL-s

The documents are already in place and pass the new pubrules' checker (ie, specberus). (There are some warnings but those are subjects of specberus discussions or tiny bugs, we have discussed those separately.)

Thanks!

Ivan
