        This is probably the froodiest document that you will read all year. It has
        been authored using new means of achieving consensus that have been made 
        possible through nanoethanol implants.

      <h2>Lots of Inlines</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to [[RFC2119]], one MUST admit that it MAY be a good idea if
        one SHOULD adhere to RECOMMENDED behaviour. It MUST NOT be a problem if one
        SHOULD NOT be impeded. What is NOT REQUIRED is probably OPTIONAL, and for 
        testing SHALL be ignored.

        Everyone knows what <acronym title="Read The Fabulous Manual">RTFM</acronym>
        stands for, which is what makes RTFM such a convenient acronym. Fun fact: 
        since W3C, MIT, and ERCIM are all mentioned in the headers, they 
        automatically get marked up accordingly. The attribute name 
        <abbr title='long description'>longdesc</abbr> is ironically enough an 
        abbreviated description of what longdesc stands for.
      </p>

        If you define a <dfn>term</dfn>, it is then easy to link to that 
        <a>term</a>. You can even link when for some reason the 
        <a title='term'>terms</a> are plural.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can have both informative references [[WEBARCH]] and normative ones 
        [[!WEBIDL]].

        Inline processing MUST NOT happen inside examples so these are untouched:
