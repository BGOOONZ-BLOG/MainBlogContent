      <!-- delete PROPOSED after AC review completed -->

      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">Web Editing Working Group</a> is to explore limitations in existing browser primitives, provide use cases for new APIs and suggest solutions either by standardizing of existing behaviors or introducing new APIs <strong>relevant for text editing</strong>. The goal is to facilitate the creation of fully-featured editing systems as well as small editors using JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
	      <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
        <p>Enabling rich editing experience on the web is currently a challenging task. One of the reasons is lack of requirements in the behavior of the contenteditable attribute in HTML. Currently, it is the only browser primitive providing a rich editing surface to web developers. Also, there is a limited support for low-level editing APIs that would allow web developers to build rich editing experiences without getting browsers' interference in this process.</p>
	      <h3 id="in-scope">In Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope of Web Editing WG covers all aspects of text editing on the web, which may include:
          <ul>
            <li>Textual input and text manipulation.</li>
            <li>Text editing related events.</li>
            <li>Selection.</li>
            <li>Clipboard.</li>
            <li>Undo.</li>
            <li>Spellcheck and grammar checking.</li>
            <li>DOM level manipulation of other elements inside of contenteditable elements.</li>
            <li>Revisiting of under-specified existing editing related features.</li>
            <li>Incubating features related to text editing that may eventually go under the scope of another WG, e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-highlight-api-1/">Highlight API</a>.</li>
          </ul></p>

        <section id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope and will not be addressed by this Working group.</p>

            <ul class="out-of-scope">
              <li>
                Non DOM-based editing, e.g. canvas or media content.
              </li>
              <li>
                Editing of content other than text and text related content. For example, an image editor, a 3D modeler or a movie cutter would be out of scope.

    <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p> All specifications produced by the Web Editing Working Group are expected to progress during
          this charter period. The charter does not include a detailed timeline for each specification because
          such information is speculative and easily becomes inaccurate. However, a rough estimation of
            completion is available in the detailed list of Deliverables when possible.

	<section id="success-criteria">
	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>Each specification must have an accompanying test suite, which is ideally developed in parallel to the specification.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
	  <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a> where applicable.</p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the Web Editing Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Web Editing Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work in <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/editing/">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss, and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use its public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-editing-tf@w3.org">public-editing-tf@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-editing-tf/">archive</a>) for administrative purposes.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'> 7 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
