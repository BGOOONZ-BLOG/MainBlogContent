  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>
    This document summarizes technologies developed or under development in W3C or elsewhere, and that can be used to build a particular type of applications (e.g. media applications, games) or to promote a particular aspect of application development (e.g. security). The document is organized in pages that present specific features per deployment status and explain their relevance to the underlying theme. Tables at the end of sections summarize the standardization and implementation status of specifications that define features presented in the text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Features are mostly presented in isolation with minimal text. This is on purpose to ease moving features around as they progress on the standardization front and get deployed in implementations.
  </p>

<section id="audience">
  <h2>Audience</h2>
  <p>
    This document is mainly targeted at developers of Web applications willing to understand the status of the Web platform for particular vertical needs (e.g. publishing) or on particular devices (e.g. mobiles). Device manufacturers may also find valuable information about features that their products should support.
  </p>
  <p>
    This document answers questions such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which technologies are available today across browsers?</li>
    <li>Which technologies should be available tomorrow?</li>
    <li>What are the features that being explored and that could lead to new technologies later on?</li>
    <li>Are there technical gaps in a given field for which there are no active standardization work today?</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section id="legend">
  <h2>Understanding tables</h2>
  <p>
    Tables at the end of sections summarize information about individual features. Columns displayed may depend on the table. Features of interest come with a name, one or more specifications (or individual features within specifications) that enable this feature, and details about each specification.
  </p>
  <section id="maturity">
    <h3>Maturity levels</h3>
    <p>
      The maturity of a feature refers to its standardization status.

    <h3>Implementation info</h3>
    <p>
      For features that target Web browsers, the "Current implementations" and "Implementation intents" columns display known implementation status in main browsers. The information is structured per implementation status, which can be one of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shipped:</strong> the feature is supported in the browser and can be used right away.</li>
      <li><strong>Experimental:</strong> the feature is planned for an upcoming version of the browser, and can be tried out in nightly builds of the browser. The feature may also be behind a flag, or it may require the use of a prefix.</li>
      <li><strong>In development:</strong> the feature is being developed but is not yet available.</li>
      <li><strong>Under consideration:</strong> the feature is not yet in development but is being considered for a future version of the browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The tables may contain implementation information about the following browsers:
    </p>
    <table>

        <th>Icon</th>
        <th>Browser name</th>

      Badges overlaid on top of browser icons convey additional implementation information:

        <th>Meaning</th>
      </thead>

        <tr>
          <td><img src="../assets/impl/mobile.svg" alt="Mobile only"></td>
          <td>Implementation information applies to the mobile version of the browser.<br/>Note that the implementation info only applies to mobile versions where the browser uses <i>its own layout engine</i> (e.g. "Firefox for Android", or "Safari for iOS"), not to mobile versions where the browser uses <i>another layout engine</i> (e.g. "Firefox for iOS"). In other words, given the implementation information available today, the mobile badge means "iOS" for Safari, and "Android" for all other browsers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="../assets/impl/desktop-mobile.svg" alt="Desktop and mobile"></td>
          <td>Implementation information applies both to the desktop and mobile versions of the browser.</td>

          <td><img src="../assets/impl/flag.svg" alt="Behind a flag"></td>
          <td>Some flag needs to be set in order to enable the feature in the browser. That flag may be a <i>preference flag</i> that the user may set in parameters, a <i>compile flag</i> that must be set before compiling the browser, or a <i>runtime flag</i> that must be set before starting the browser.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="../assets/impl/prefix.svg" alt="Prefix required"></td>
          <td>A prefix must be used to access the feature. For instance, in Firefox, this usually means adding something like a <code>-moz-</code> prefix for CSS properties and a <code>moz</code> prefix to API functions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="../assets/impl/partial.svg" alt="Partial implementation"></td>
          <td>Implementation info is not complete and support may be partial.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      On devices that support hovering, a tooltip that summarizes the implementation information is displayed when the user moves over a browser icon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the hoods, the implementation information is being gathered from the following platform status sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://caniuse.com/">Can I Use?</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/features">Chrome Platform Status</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">MDN Browser Compatibility Data</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/">Microsoft Edge web platform features status and roadmap</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://webkit.org/status/">WebKit Feature Status</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Clicking on a browser icon in an implementation should take you to the right page on the platform status Web site that provided the implementation information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absence of implementation information for a given browser usually means that the feature is not supported at all, and that it is not being developed for now in that browser. However, it may also mean that the implementation information is not yet available. If you notice missing or incorrect implementation info, please create an <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-roadmaps/issues/new">issue on the GitHub repository of this document</a>.
