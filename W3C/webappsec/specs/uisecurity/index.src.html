Abstract:
	UI Security and the Visiblity API defines both a
	declarative and imperative means for resources
	displayed in an embedded context to protect 
	themselves against having their content obscured,
	moved, or otherwise displayed in a misleading
	manner.

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <em>This section is not normative.</em>

		Composite or "mash-up" web applications built using iframes
		are ubiquitous because they allow users to interact seamlessly and
		simultaneously with content from multiple origins while
		maintaining isolation boundaries that are essential to
		security and privacy for both users and applications.

		However, those boundaries are not absolute.  In particular,
		the visual and temporal integrity of embedded content is
		not protected from manipulation by the embedding resource.
		An embedding resource might constrain the viewport,
		draw over, transform, reposition, or resize the user's
		view of a third-party resource.

		Collectively known as User Interface Redressing, the goal
		of such manipulations might be to entice the user to interact
		with embedded content without knowing its context, (e.g. to 
		send a payment or share content) commonly known as "clickjacking",
		or to convince paid content that it is being shown to the user
		when it is actually obscured, commonly known in the advertising
		business as "display fraud".

    Existing anti-clickjacking measures such as frame-busting 
    scripts and headers granting origin-based embedding permissions have 
		shortcomings which prevent their application to important use-cases.
    Frame-busting scripts, for example, rely on browser behavior that has not been 
		engineered to provide a security guarantee and as a consequence,
		such scripts may be unreliable if loaded inside a sandbox
    or otherwise disabled. The X-Frame-Options header and the frame-ancestors
		Content Security Policy directive offer an all-or-none approach to
		display of embedded content that is not appropriate for content
		which may be embedded in arbitrary locations, or known locations
		which might still be adversarial.

		This document defines mechanisms to allow resources to
		protect themselves from embedding contexts which might otherwise
		interfere with their display and interaction characteristics.
		First, it defines an imperative API by which a resource can
		request that a conforming user agent guarantee unmodified
		display of its viewport, and report events on the success or
		failure of meeting such guarantees.  This API should be suitable
		for e.g. paid content such as advertising to receive trustworthy
		signals about its viewability from a conforming user agent.
		
		Secondly, this specification defines a declarative mechanism
		(via a Content Security Poicy directive) to request visiblity
		protection and receive notification, via event properties or
		out-of-band reporting, if certain events are delivered to
		a resource while it does not meet its requested visiblity 
		contract.

    ISSUE: how to interact with frame-ancestors and XFO?

    <em>This section is not normative.</em>

    UI Redressing attacks rely on fooling the subjective perceptions of
    human actors to induce them to interact with a web application out of
    its intended context.  Because of this, the specific mechanisms which
    may be used in attack and defense may vary greatly with the details of
    a user agent implementation.  For example, attacks which rely on
    redressing the cursor may not apply in a touch environment, or entire
    classes of attack may be impossible on a text-only browser or screen
    reader.

    Similarly, the implementation of the policies specified herein is highly
    dependent on internal architecture and implementation strategies of
    the user agent; such strategies may vary greatly between user agents
    or even across versions or platforms for a single user agent.

    This specification provides a normative means by which a resource
    owner can communicate to a user agent its desire for additional
    protective measures, actions to take if violations are detected,
    and tuning hints which may be useful for certain means of
    implementation.  A user agent is conformant if it understands
		these directives and makes a best effort to provide the desired 
		security properties, which might require no additional implementation
		steps, e.g. in the case of a screen reader that does not support
		embedded resources in a manner that is subject to any of the
		attack classes of concern.

    While the indeterminacy of the user agent implementation protects
    applications from needing to constantly update their policies as
    user agents make internal changes, application authors should
    understand that even a conformant user agent cannot make
    perfect security guarantees against UI Redressing.
    Some potential checks suggested here might not be made as a
    consequence of implementation strategies, or to avoid unacceptable
    performance costs, and the intrepretation of policies
    might differ among user agents. (e.g. a tolerance hint may appy
    strictly to rectangular clipping in one implementation but
    to pixel or sub-pixel comparisions in another)
    
    These directives should be used as part of a comprehensive risk
    mitigation strategy with an appropriate understanding of their
    limitations.

 <h2 id="directives">CSP Directive</h2>

    This section describes the content security policy
    directives introduced in this specification.

        <h3 id="input-protection"><code>input-protection</code></h3>

        The <code>input-protection</code> directive, if present or
        implied, is declaritive syntatic sugar for the same fundamental
				mechanism as the JavaScript API.  If a user input event, such as
        <code>click</code>, <code>keypress</code>, <code>touch</code>, and
        <code>drag</code>, is generated when the document is not in a
				visibility state that matches the visibility policy, this
				directive is violated.

        If the <code>input-protection</code> directive is set as
        part of a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>, violating 
        the policy should cancel delivery of the UI event to the
        target and and fire a violation event.  If set as
        part of a <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code>,
        triggering of the heuristic should result in the event being
        delivered with the <code>unsafe</code> attribute on the
        <code>UIEvent</code> set to <code>true</code>
        and fire a violation event. (TODO: Pointer Events?)

        The optional directive value allows resource authors to
        provide <a href="#input-protection-options">options</a>
        for heuristic tuning in the form of space-separated
        <code>option-name=option-value</code> pairs.

        <pre>
directive-name    = "input-protection"
directive-value   = ["display-time=" num-val]
										["height=" num-val]
										["width=" num-val]
										["protected-element=" id-selector]
        </pre>

        If the policy does not contain a value for this directive
        or any of the hint name=value pairs are absent, the user
        agent SHOULD apply default values for hints as described
        in the following.

        <dl id="input-protection-options">
            <dt>
                <code>display-time</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                is a numeric value from 0 to 10000 that specifies how long, in
                milliseconds, the screen area containing the protected user
                interface must have unmodified viewability properties
                when the event is processed.
                
                If not specified, it defaults to 800. If a value out of the
                range stated above is specified, it defaults to the nearest
                value between the lower and the higher bounds.
            </dd>

            <dt>
                <code>width</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
								is a numeric value that specifies the minimum viewable area's
								X dimension.  If unspecified, it defaults to the width of the
								protectedElement's boundingClientRect.
            </dd>

            <dt>
                <code>height</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
								is a numeric value that specifies the minimum viewable area's
								Y dimension.  If unspecified, it defaults to the height of the
								protectedElement's boundingClientRect.
            </dd>

            <dt>
                <code>protected-element</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
								An id querySelector expression which uniquely identifies an element in the protected
								document.  The protected element's boundingClientRect will be used as
								the boundaries for visibility calculations.  If a minWidth and minHeight are
								specified, they are calculated relative to the origin of the protected element's
								boundingClientRect.  If unspecified, this value defaults to the Document element.
            </dd>
        </dl>

		<h3 id="visibility">Visibility</h3>
			An area is defined as <em>visible</em> if it has <em>visual</em> and <em>spatio-temporal
			integrity</em> and meets minimum required width and height requirements.

	  <h4 id="visual-integrity">Visual Integrity</h4>
			An area has <em>visual integrity</em> if it is not subject to being occuluded, drawn over,
			blurred, zoomed, clipped, rotated, scaled, transformed or subject to any other effects which 
			would change its appearance relative to being painted in the same size viewport in the root
			window.  The property of <em>visual integrity</em> applies to rectangular areas, and an area
			only has the property if no such changes occur within its entire bounding rectangle.

	 	<h4 id="spatio-temporal-integrity">Spatio-Temporal Integrity</h4>
			An area's <em>spatio-temporal integrity</em> refers to it being displayed without modifications
			to its display state, viewport size, position of content within the viewport, or position
			of the viewport relative to the root window's coordinate system.  Any modification to these
			properties generates a new visibility state.

		<h4 id="visibility-state">Visibility State</h4>
			A <em>visibility state</em> is the description of a document's <em>visual</em> and <em>spatio-temporal
			integrity</em> and size and the elapsed time since those properties have last changed.

<h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

	<h3 id="requesting-visibility">Requesting Visibility</h3>

	When a document calls requestVisibility(), the user agent SHOULD attempt to display the document's
	viewport in a manner that is not subject to perturbation by ancestor frames and MUST report
	visibilityEvents.

	NOTE: The exact procedures of this algorithm are not normative. Any algorithm which produces
	equivalent results is conformant and implementations are encouraged to optimize wherever possible.

	1. 	Complete any pending layout and painting tasks, (find more precice language here)
			including layer hoisting as described in the non-normative implementation advice.  

	2. 	Visibility events should not be fired until DOMContentReady has fired on the protected
			document and all ancestor documents.

	3.	Calculate a visibiltyEvent

			1.	Obtain the height and width of the protected document's viewport

			2.	Obtain the x and y coordinates of the origin of the protected document's viewport in
					the coordinate system of the root window.

			3.	Obtain the bounding rectangle of the protected document that has <em>visual integrity</em>.

					1. 	If the entire viewport does not have <em>visual integrity</em>, the user agent MAY
							always report a rectangle of zero dimensions, e.g. if the viewport is subject to 
							transformations with complex outlines, or modifications which section the viewport
							into multiple distinct visible regions.
					
					2.	Otherwise, the user agent MAY report the largest bounding rectangle within the
							viewport with <em>visual integrity</em>, if e.g. only a small portion of the
							viewport is cropped.
			
		 	4. 	Dispatch a <em>visibilityEvent</em> to the window object of the protected document.	

	4.	Whenever the <em>spatio-temporal</em> or <em>visual integrity</em> of the protected 
			document's viewport changes, a new <em>visibility state</em> is created and step 3
			of this algorithm MUST be repeated.

	Internal changes to the contents of the protected document such as CSS effects, 
	modifications to the DOM, or animations, MUST NOT create a new <em>visibility state</em>,
	but internally generated events which scroll or resize the viewport MUST.

	<h3 id="input-protection-algorithm">Input Protection Algorithm</h3>

	Implementation of the <em>input-protection</em> CSP directive is internally defined in
	terms of the <em>Requesting Visibilty</em> algorithm.  
	
	1.	If the directive is specified, begin as if <em>requestVisibiity()</em> was invoked.

	2.	At step 3.4 (dispatch a <em>visibilityEvent</em>), do not dispatch the event (unless
			visibility events have also been requested with the imperative API) but retain
			the calculated values of the <em>visibility state</em>, plus a timestamp, as internal state.

	3.  At step 4 (handle new <em>visibility states</em>), replace the retained internal state with
			the new calculated values and a new timestamp.
	
	5.  Parse the directive options and determine values (or use defaults) for <em>display time</em>,
			<em>height</em>, <em>width</em> and <em>protected-element</em>.
	
	During hit testing for user initiated events (UIEvents, PointerEvents, drag-and-drop, 
	copy/paste, etc.):

	ISSUE: do we need keypress or a keyboard-driven click events?
	
	1.	Examine the element the event is delivered to to deterimine if it matches the id 
			selector that is the value of <em>protected-element</em>.

		1.  If element matches the selector, continue to step 2.

		2.  If the element does not match and the element has a parent
				
			1.	Set element to element.parent and go to step 1.1

		3.	If no element in the set of elements which might handle the event matches the
				selector, deliver the event and terminate this portion of the algorithm.
				Continue monitoring <em>visibility states</em>.

	2. If an event will be delivered to the <em>protected-element</em> or one of its children

		1.	Get the current timestamp and the retained internal state of the most recent
				<em>visibility state</em>

		2.	Get the bounding rectangle of the <em>protected-element</em>

		3.	If <em>height</em> and <em>width</em> were not set explicitly as part of the
				directive, set them to the current height and width of the 
				protected element's bounding rectangle for the purposes of processing this event

		2.	Get the viewport height and width of the displayport for the protected document.

			1.	If the size of the viewport is less in either dimention than the <em>height</em> 
					and <em>width</em> values, go to <b>handle a violation</b>.

		2.	Get the bounding rectangle of the <em>protected-element</em> and determine the x and
				y coordinates of the origin of that rectangle in the document's own coordinate system.

		3.	Calculate the protected rectangle that must be visibile by applying the <em>height</em> and
				<em>width</em> values to those origin coordinates.  (if these values are not explicitly
				specified in the directive options, this is the bounding rectangle of the element)

		4.	If the protected rectangle is not entirely within the rectangle defined by the 
				<em>visibleX</em>, <em>visibleY</em>, <em>visibleWidth</em>, and <em>visibleHeight</em>
				values of the <em>visibility state</em>, go to <b>handle a violation</b>.

		5.	If the protected rectangle is entirely within the visible rectangle, subtract the
				timestamp of the <em>visibility state</em> from the current timestamp and compare it to
				the <em>display-time</em> value of the directive, or 800 if unset.  If the calculated
				value is less than the specified value, go to <b>handle a violation</b>.

		6.	Otherwise, deliver the event as normal and terminate this portion of the algorithm.
				Continue monitoring <em>visibility states</em>.

	ISSUE: Cursor redressing.

		<h4 id="handle-a-violation">Handling Violations</h4>

		When a violation is raised:

		1.	If the directive is being enforced, cancel delivery of the event and Fire a Violation Event
				as defined in [[!CSP2]].

		2.  If the directive is being monitored, add a property <em>unsafe</em> to the event, set to
				<em>true</em>, and Fire a Violation Event as defined in [[CSP2]].


	<h3 id="usafe-attribute">Unsafe Attribute</h3>

	<pre class="idl">

	<dl dfn-for="Event">

			Will be set to true if the event fired when the document's <em>visibility state</em> did not

<h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation Considerations</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	The internal details of the full pipeline between the normatively specified portions of
	the Web Platform, such as the Document Object Model and CSS, and pixels actually displayed
	to the user, is not standardized.  There may exist considerable variability in the 
	implementations and strategies employed between different user agents, or even within a
	single user agent on platforms with differing capabilities.

	The implementation strategy detailed in this section is not normative. Any 
	strategy which produces correct outcomes for the normative algorithms is conformant and
	implementers are encouraged to optimize whenever possible.

	The possibility of wide variance among user agent implementations notwithstanding, the
	normative algorithms of this specification are designed such that a highly performant 
	implementation should be possible on the most common internal architectures that are
	state-of-the-art as of the time of writing.

	Roughly, at some point along the transformation from DOM to pixels, a user agent will
	arrive at an intermediate representation which represents a set of surfaces to be
	painted / clipped / scrolled.  We will designate this a GraphicsLayer.

	1.	On the way to preparing the set of GraphicsLayers, determine if an iframe which has
			invoked requestVisibliity() will be put into its own GraphicsLayer.  If it is not, apply
			whatever implemenation-specific transformations are necessary to generate it as a
			distinct layer.  (e.g. add translatez(0) to the documentElement)

	2.	Determine the GraphicsLayer associated with the root document, topmost in the window.

	3.	Without reordering prior intermediate representations in a manner which would 
			change event dispatching, hit testing or the DOM as exposed to JavaScript, reorder
			the GraphicsLayers such that the iframe which has requested visibility is on top 
			of the root GraphicsLayer. (e.g. by making it a direct child of the root layer)

	NOTE: By reordering the layers such that an iframe which has requested visibility is topmost,
	it should naturally avoid being subject to nearly all manipulations and transformations 
	by parent layers which could otherwise change its display characteristics.

	4. 	Clipping transformations must be respected.  An iframe requesting visibility
			is not allowed to take over more of the display than allowed by its ancestor documents.

		1. Determine the size of the protected GraphicsLayer to be raised.

		2. Determine the position of that rectangle on the top viewport.

	5. Re-implement necessary clipping that would be otherwise bypassed by the layer raising.

		1.	Obtain the bounds of the iframe in the viewport space of its parent

		2.  Intersect those boundaries with those of the to-be-raised GraphicsLayer

		3.  Repeat by finding the bounds in the viewport space of the next ancestor document, 
				until the topmost document in the window is reached.

	6. Determine and clip appropriately for the position of content in the viewport.

		1.	Correct the boundaries, position and offset of the to-be-raised GrapicsLayer
				to account for scrolling of both the root document and any intermediate frames

		ISSUE: Dan, I'm not sure I got those last 2 or so step exactly correct....
	
	7.	If multiple	iframes in the rendering tree have requested visibility, they may overlap,
			and only one can be topmost.  It is undefined which should actually be topmost, only
			that each knows what its true visible boundaries are.  If there are other to-be-raised
			GraphicsLayers subsequent and superior to this one, calculate and then intersect those
			boundaries with these boundaries to arrive at the final visible area.

	8. 	Report back the viewport and visible portion.

<h2 id="privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	The timing of visibilityEvents may leak some information across Origin boundaries.  An embedded
	document might have previously been unable to learn that it was obscured, or the timing and
	nature of repositioning of ancestor frame's viewports.  In some circumstances, this information
	leak might have privacy implications, but the granularity and nature of the information is such
	that it should not be of much value to attackers.  Compared to anti-clickjacking strategies
	which rely on pixel comparisions, the side channels exposed by comparing rectulangar masks are
	very low bandwidth. The privacy gains from preventing clickjacking, considered in a holistic
	system context, may be quite large.

<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

	UI Redressing and Clickjacking attacks rely on violating the contextual and temporal 
	integrity of embedded content. Because these attacks target the subjective perception 
	of the user and not well-defined security boundaries, the heuristic protections 
	afforded by the input-protection directive can never be 100% effective for every 
	interface. It provides no protection against certain classes of attacks, such as 
	displaying content around an embedded resource that appears to extend a trusted 
	dialog but provides misleading information.

	User of accessibility tools MUST NOT be prevented from accessing content

	undefine requestVisibility(), report a synthesized event with a
	<em>visibility state</em> at onDOMContentReady that indicates the entire
	document is visible, and/or redefine violation handling for
