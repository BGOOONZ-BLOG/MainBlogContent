REACTIFY:
    ✓ move all the existing JS into an "OLD" directory, to be ported one by one
    ✓ rewrite the css to have an entry point, use ungrid and normalize, reuse the same stuff as AN
    ✓ rewrite index.html to just load the real dependencies
    ✓ have the root render as a react component
    ✓ get the login logic from AN and port it to the model we have here
    ✓ render the login
    ✓ start porting over the rest piece by piece

MAILBOX:
    - keep track of last seen
        - maybe a single POST with keys all being the filter names, and values the last-seen
          date stamp. Does a count on the DB, returns the count for each.
        - use that to poll the DB every ~5 minutes and update the UI. The currently shown view
          gets some sort of button? Use notification API?
    - show badges
    ✓ show list of mailboxes that depends on configured filters
    ✓ store/load filter preferences from user
    ✓ drop the widgets ideas
    ✓ merge configuration of sources and event filters list, they really should be edited in just
      the one place

DB:
    ✓ kill all the old DBs, and just have a store that's for Couch
    ✓ have the DB be configured when run, not on load

PHEME:
    ✓ add support for minutes using https://cvs.w3.org/recent-commits?user=swick
    ✓ add the W3C RSS
