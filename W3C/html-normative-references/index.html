      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to note that many factors can be taken into account in order to declare
        a reference “weak” (basically unproblematic) instead of “strong” (which requires stability
        at the risk of breaking the HTML specification). These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Interfacing through clean imports of named items, in such a way that HTML is sufficiently
          shielded from the internal details of the import.
        </li>
        <li>
          The reference (or its applicable parts) is deployed in such a way that changes to it that
          could affect HTML would cause major breakage in non-negligible amounts of deployed
          content. Such changes are therefore considered impossible.
        </li>
        <li>
          The reference is broadly implemented, tested, and/or deployed; and if the specification
          defining it is not yet “stable” it is only due to incidental issues (e.g. unavailable
          editor, overwhelming process). It effectively cannot change in a breaking manner.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The amount of usage and the granularity of the reference also matter. For instance, a good
        case could be made for the DOM to be a weak reference but it is of such importance that we
        chose to err on the side of marking it “strong”. Conversely, some massive specification may
        be imported (e.g. ASN.1) but the reference is fine-grained to a small part and is therefore
        well-contained, classifying it as within the realm of safety.
