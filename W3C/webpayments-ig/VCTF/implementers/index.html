  <h1 id="title">Implementation Commitments for Verifiable Claims Working Group</h1>
<p>Last substantial update 18 June 2016, editoral update 4 Nov 2016</p>

  <p>The following organizations have committed to implementing and/or deploying
the output of the Verifiable Claims Working Group if the work successfully
produces a W3C standard (see <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webpayments-ig/VCTF/charter/">Draft charter</a>). The implementations are broken out by roles
in the ecosystem and each organization has provided rough numbers for the
reach of their Verifiable Claims deployments. These commitments, whilst sincere, are not binding.</p>
