# Introduction #

This page contains some preliminary thinking about priorities for making EPUB a de jure (ISO-level, aka ISO, IEC, or JTC) International Standard.

# IDPF Goals for De Jure Standardization (DRAFT) #

  1. Ensure specifications remains freely available (in some form)
  1. Ensure specification's free-to-use status is not encumbered
  1. Enable IDPF to continue to add capabilities to the EPUB base standard in a timely manner (i.e. w/out de jure standards group overhead) to meet needs of our members (such could be appendices or extensions to the base)
  1. Minimize/avoid incompatible technical changes in the process of creating a de jure standard, in interests of retaining compatibility/interoperability
  1. Minimize effort for IDPF staff/volunteers/members in the process; of course some work is a given but we would aim to not have this be a huge undertaking wrt IDPF time investment.
  1. Achieve a high-quality / well-regarded ISO-level International Standard
  1. Ensure that the process and resulting standard is truly international (IDPF is a global organization not a national group)
  1. Achieve an ISO-level International Standard in a relatively timely manner (understanding that it will take time, esp. given unfinished status of several dependent W3C specs).
  1. Decide on a particular path to get to ISO-level status during 2011, to make sure to focus efforts and be able to clearly communicate the expected process.
