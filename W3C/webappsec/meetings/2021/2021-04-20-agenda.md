## WebAppSec WG

[Tuesday, April 20th: 18:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20210420T1800) (11:00 California, 14:00 Boston, 19:00 London, 20:00 Berlin)

### Draft Agenda

*   Charter
    *   Brief update on current status.
    *   Work mode for drafts vs living specs (WHATWG has a [nice example](https://whatwg.org/working-mode#changes)).

*   WebCrypto
    *   Interest in well-scoped additions (e.g. [ed25519](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/466), [UUID](https://github.com/WICG/uuid)). Is this document something we should adopt into this group?

*   Permissions API
    *   Can this move forward? Substantive changes have been few and far between.

*   Odds and ends:
    *   Policy Container: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6504
    *   Credentiallessness: https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/582
    *   Cross-origin Isolation deployment challenges: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6364
