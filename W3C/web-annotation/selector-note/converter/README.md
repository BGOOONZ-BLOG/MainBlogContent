Proof of concept converter between the JSON and the URI+Fragment representation of Selectors and States. See the separate [editorsâ€™ draft](http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/selector-note/index-respec.html) for details.

The script is rudimentary in the sense that it does not check all possible error situations, and does not provide more information on bugs than the exception messages, as raised by the underlying API-s. It definitely does not check the validity of the Selector/State structures, for example.

The files are:

* `converter.js`: the top level (jQuery based) layer to perform the conversion. It contains the Selector/State -> URI conversion code (which is quite simple), but relies on the separate parser for the URI -> Selector/State conversion
* `fragment.pegjs`: a [PEG.js](http://pegjs.org/documentation) grammar for the fragment specification
* `fragment.js`: parser generated by `pegjs`, to be used in `node.js`.
* `parser.js`: parser generated by `pegjs`, to be used in a browser. Use the `--export-var window.Parser` option with `pegjs`.
* `index.html`: Web interface for the conversion
