## Description of service
FMI Simple Observation Features Pilot with WFS 3.0 project.

Demo service is available at: http://beta.fmi.fi/data/3/wfs/sofp The service provides Hirlam and Harmonie weather forecasts and weather observations from Finland. The service is published as a demo and FMI will give no warranty about it.

The complete project is located in several repositories. Core is available at https://github.com/vaisala-oss/sofp-core. Simple Observation Features are defined and developed at https://github.com/opengeospatial/omsf-profile. Finally, a simple OpenLayers demo build upon this service is available at: https://vaisala-oss.github.io/sofp-demo/.

This backend is developed by Finnish Meteorological Institute. The whole project is done in collaboration with Vaisala and Spatineo. All software is under MIT license.

### [Best Practice 1: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for Spatial Things](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#globally-unique-ids)

#### Conformance statement
Conforms, but could be improved

Test | Conforms
---|---
Check that within the data [Spatial Things](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#dfn-spatial-thing), such as countries, regions and people, are referred to by HTTP URIs or by short identifiers that can be converted to HTTP URIs. Ideally dereferencing the URIs should return the [Spatial Thing](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#dfn-spatial-thing), however, they have value as globally scoped variables whether they dereference or not | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>


#### How-to
Each item is given an unique id. Forecasts are identified with pattern *parameter:producer:level_type:level:forecast_type:forecast_number:generation:area:time:area_interpolation_method:time_interpolation_method:level_interpolation_method*. Data can be accessed, if it still exists, using WFS GetFeatureById operation. Note that old forecasts are not available though.

#### To-do
ID pattern need to be defined for observations.

### [Best Practice 2: Make your spatial data indexable by search engines](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#indexable-by-search-engines)

#### Conformance statement
 - Conforms

Test | Conforms
---|---
Using a Web browser, search for the landing page of your dataset | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>
Using a Web browser, check that you can browse to human-readable HTML pages for each [Spatial Thing](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#dfn-spatial-thing) that the dataset describes | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>

#### How-to
The service provides both html and json encoding. Encoding is decided by content negotiation. ?f=json can be used to override the encoding.

#### To-do
-

### [Best Practice 3: Link resources together to create the Web of Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#linking)

#### Conformance statement
Not applicable with current content

Test | Conforms
---|---
Check that hyperlinks are distinguishable within the data â€” a string-literal that happens to contain a URL is insufficient | n/a
Check that hyperlinks use global identifiers, preferably HTTP URIs, to identify the link target | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>
Check that hyperlinks use typed relationships, and that the definition of the link relation type can be located in order to determine how to interpret the hyperlink | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>

#### How-to
No hyperlinks between data objects. Links within the service are defined by WFS3 standard and are equipped with rel attribute.

#### To-do
Add hyperlinks when new data is added

### [Best Practice 4: Use spatial data encodings that match your target audience](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#semantic-thing)

#### Conformance statement
 - Conforms, but could be improved

Test | Conforms
---|---
Check if spatial data is encoded, so that it can be understood and re-used reliably | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>
Consider the main target audience or audiences of a web page or service, and check if spatial information is provided in a way appropriate for that audience | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>

#### How-to
We use [O&M Simple Profile JSON](https://github.com/opengeospatial/omsf-profile) to encode our data. We gather feedback via Facebook development group and a [hackaton](https://challenge.inspire-helsinki-2019.fi).

#### To-do

---|---
[Geometries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#dfn-geometry) are made available in possibly different formats and levels of complexity, considering their intended uses and their consumption on the Web | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul>
The chosen [geometry](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#dfn-geometry) descriptions comply with [Best Practice 6: Provide geometries at the right level of accuracy, precision, and size](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#multiplegeometries), [Best Practice 7: Choose coordinate reference systems to suit your user's applications](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#bp-crs-choice), and [Best Practice 8: State how coordinate values are encoded](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#bp-crs) | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul>

#### Conformance statement
 - Does not conform

Test | Conforms?
---|---
Information about a given [Spatial Thing](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#dfn-spatial-thing), or set of Spatial Things, will be relevant for a particular time or time-period. Check that this information is stated. | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul>

 - Does not conform

Test | Conforms?
---|---
Check if a test client can simulate calls and the API returns the expected responses. | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>
Check that the service avoids using http as a tunnel for calls to custom methods, and check that URIs do not contain method names. | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>
Check that every call enabled by your API is described in your documentation. Make sure you provide details of what parameters are required or optional and what each call returns. | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>
Check the Time To First Successful Call (i.e. being capable of doing a successful request to the API within a few minutes will increase the chances that the developer will stick to your API). | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul>
