<h1>Low Vision User Needs Coverage</h1>
<p>This page analyzes low vision user needs coverage:</p>
<ul>
<li>In WCAG 2.1</li>
<li>Potentially for 2.2</li>
<li>Possible for Silver</li>
<li>Responsibility in content authoring, browser, OS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Note: </em>Do not change the wording in the first column, since it is taken directly from the <a href-"https://www.w3.org/TR/low-vision-needs/">User Needs/Requirements draft</a>. If you suggest different wording, add it in [brackets] to the first column <strong>or</strong> in the last column "Thoughts".</strong></p>
