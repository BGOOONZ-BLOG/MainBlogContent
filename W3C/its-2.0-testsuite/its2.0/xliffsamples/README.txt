This folder contains examples for XML and HTML5 documents extracted to XLIFF using ITS and using the ITS to XLIFF mapping.

They are not part of the conformance test suite, but provided as help for developer who needs sample input documents for their own tests.

The directory 'inputdata' contains the XLIFF output created from the input test files using Tikal's extraction (still under development). Please note that those XLIFF document make little sense because only a single data category is applied to them.
