## Linking ##

_On:Keith, Peter_

Both Peter S's [links to RDFa-encoded reference data](ImplementationProposalLinkingToRDFa.md) and Keith F's  [PURL-based EPUB Identifiers](LinkingImplementationProposals#PURL-based_EPUB_Identifiers.md) have been discussed. Peter S has proposed moving to an 'epub:' URI scheme instead of using HTTP URIs. Does the Working Group feel that recommending an (IANA unregistered) 'epub:' scheme in EPUB3 is a good solution?
