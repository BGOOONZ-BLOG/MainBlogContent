    <p>When <a>user interface components</a> are invisible until hover or focus makes them visible, provide a visible indicator that the components are available, except when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The same functionality is available through a component on the same page, or on a different step in a multi-step process, without requiring pointer hover or keyboard focus to make it visible;</li>
        <li>The component provides keyboard-only functionality;</li>
        <li>A mechanism is available to make the components persistently visible;</li>
        <li>Hiding the visual indicator is <a>essential</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">User interface components can be available through other visible components such as sub-menus, edit buttons, tabs, or thumbnails of media.</p>
    <p class="ednote">The working group is interested in feedback about whether there are Components determined by the user agent that should not be in scope.</p>
