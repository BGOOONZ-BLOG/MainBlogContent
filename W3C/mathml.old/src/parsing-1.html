      <p>A MathML document must be a well-formed XML document using elements in the MathML
         namespace as defined by this specification, however it is not required that the document
         refer to any specific Document Type Definition (DTD) or schema that specifies MathML.
         It
         is sometimes advantageous <em>not</em> to specify such a language definition as these
         files are large, often much larger than the MathML expression and unless they have
         been
         previously cached by the MathML application, the time taken to fetch the DTD or schema
         may
         have an appreciable effect on the processing of the MathML document.</p>
      
      
      <p>Note that if no DTD is specified with a DOCTYPE declaration, that entity
         references (for example to refer to MathML characters by name) may not be used. The
         document should be encoded in an encoding (for example UTF-8) in which all needed
         characters may be encoded as character data, or characters may be referenced using
         numeric
         character references, for example &amp;#x222B; rather than &amp;int;</p>
      
      
      <p>If a MathML fragment is parsed without a DTD, in other words as a well-formed XML
         fragment, it is the responsibility of the processing application to treat the white
         space
         characters occurring outside of token elements as not significant.</p>
      
      
      <p>However, in many circumstances, especially while producing or editing MathML, it is
         useful to use a language definition to constrain the editing process or to check the
         correctness of generated files. The following section, <a href="#parsing_usingrnc"></a>,
         discusses the RelaxNG Schema for Mathml4 [[RELAX-NG]], which forms a normative
         part of the specification. Following that, <a href="#parsing_usingxsd"></a>, and <a href="#parsing_usingdtd"></a> discuss alternative languages definition using the document type
         definitions (DTD) and the W3C XML schema language, [[XMLSchemas]], both of
         which are derived from the normative RelaxNG schema automatically.  One should note
         that
         the schema definitions of the language is currently stricter than the DTD version.
         That
         is, a schema validating processor will declare invalid documents that are declared
         valid
         by a (DTD) validating XML parser. This is partly due to the fact that the XML schema
         language may express additional constraints not expressable in the DTD, and partly
         due to
         the fact that for reasons of compatibility with earlier releases, the DTD is intentionally
         forgiving in some places and does not enforce constraints that are specified in the
         text
         of this specification.</p>
