      <p>Native mobile application stores have made it much easier for developers to monetize some of their applications, either by selling the application itself to users, or by providing in-app purchases.</p>

      <p>While Web applications can use well-known on-line payment solutions, these solutions have so far proved much harder to use on mobile devices.</p>

          <p>Following a successful <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/">workshop on Web payments</a> in 2014 and discussions on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">use cases and priorities for Web payments</a> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payment Interest Group</a>, W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/charter-201510.html">chartered a Web Payments Working Group</a> to develop browser APIs to facilitate payment operations in Web applications:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The <a data-featureid="payment-request">Payment Request API</a> defines an API to allow merchants (i.e. web sites selling physical or digital goods) to utilize one or more payment methods with minimal integration. In this model, browsers facilitate the payment flow between merchant and user.</li>
            <li>The <a data-featureid="payment-method-id">Payment Method Identifiers</a> specification defines payment method identifiers and how they are validated, and, where
            applicable, minted and formally registered with the W3C.</li>
            <li>The <a data-featureid="payment-method-manifest">Payment Method Manifest</a> specification defines a machine-readable manifest file that describes default payment applications that are associated with a given payment method, as well as the list of origins that are permitted to provide payment applications for this payment method.</li>
            <li>The <a data-featureid="payment-method-basic-card">Payment Method: Basic Card</a> specification describes data structures that enable the use of debit, credit, or prepaid cards in the Payment Request API.</li>
            <li>The <a data-featureid="payment-handler">Payment Handler API</a> defines a standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and applications.</li>

          <p><a data-featureid="web-monetization">Web Monetization</a> proposes an API to enable continuous and small payments on the Web facilitated by the browser and the user's Web Monetization provider, allowing to compensate creators for the content they provide on the Web, be that articles, mobile games, APIs, etc.</p>
