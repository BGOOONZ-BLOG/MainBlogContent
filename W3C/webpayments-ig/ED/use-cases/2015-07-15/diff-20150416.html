Abstract

</h2>
<p>
This
document
is
a
prioritized
list
of
Web
payments
use
cases.
Guided
by
these
use
cases,
the
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
Web
Payments
Interest
Group
plans
to
derive
architecture
and
associated
technology
requirements
to
integrate
payments
into
the
Open
Web
Platform.
That
work
will
form
the
basis
of
conversations
with
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
groups
and
the
broader
payments
industry
about
what
standards
(from
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
or
other
organizations)
will
be
necessary
to
fulfill
the
use
cases
and
make
payments
over
the
Web
easier
and
more
secure.

The

has
only
had
the
opportunity
to
review
a
handful
of
the
40+
use
cases,
120+
requirements,
hundreds
of
pages
of
payments
research
submitted
to
the
group
via
various
other
standards
group
output
such
as
ISO20022,
research
documents
from
X9
and
the
US
Federal

documents
from
the
Web

Community
Group,
and
input
from
the
general
public.
Our
desire
is
to
align
with
the
larger
payments

when
it's
possible
to
do
so.
Expect

Introduction
</span>
</h2>
<p>
ECommerce
is
thriving
and
continues
to
expand.
However,
fragmentation
of
payment
systems
is
limiting
the
growth
potential
as
are
problems
â€”
both
real
and
perceived
â€”
such
as
fraud
and
usability.
</p>
<p>
Because
the
Web
is
ubiquitous,
strengthening
support
for
Web
payments
has
the
potential
to
create
new
opportunities
for
businesses
and
customers.
Mobile
devices
are
already
transforming
the
industry
by
supplanting
physical
payment
cards
in
proximity
payments,
voucher
distribution,
and
identification
when
people
authenticate
to
a
scanner,
point
of
sale,
or
access
gate.
Although
we
are
seeing
innovation
in
mobile
payment
systems,
the
lack
of
standards
makes
it
more
difficult
to
adapt
to
new
payment
approaches
or
integrate
new
payment
providers.
</p>
<p>
The
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
Web
Payments
Interest
Group
is
developing
a
roadmap
for
standards
to
improve
the
interoperability
of
payments
using
Web
technologies
for
both
online
and
brick-and-mortar
(offline)
scenarios.
This
will
help
achieve
greater
interoperability
among
merchants
and
their
customers,
payment
providers,
software
vendors,
mobile
operators,
native
mobile
apps,
and
payment
networks.
The
roadmap
will
include
<a title="payment scheme" href="#dfn-payment-scheme" class="internalDFN">
payment
schemes
</a>
in
use
today
(such
as
electronic
<del class="diff-old">cheques,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">checks,
</ins>
credit
cards,
direct
debit,
and
cryptocurrencies)
and
those
of
the
future.
The
roadmap
will
be
derived
from
the
use
cases
listed
below.

Why
This
Work
is
Important
</span>
</h3>
<p>
The
Web
Payments
work
is
not
just
about
making
payments
easier,
faster,
more
secure,
and
more
innovative.
There
are
many
people
around
the
world
that
today's
financial
system
does
not
reach.
These
people
are
called
the
world's
unbanked
(or
underbanked).
The
unbanked
often
live
<del class="diff-old">pay
cheque
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">paycheck
</ins>
to
<del class="diff-old">pay
cheque,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">paycheck,
</ins>
do
not
have
access
to
savings
accounts
or
low-fee
<del class="diff-old">cheque
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">check
</ins>
cashing
services,
lines
of
credit,
or
a
way
of
saving
for
their
future.
Being
unable
to
plan
for
one's
financial
future
often
results
in
a
focus
on
the
short-term,
which
creates
a
vicious
cycle
of
not
being
able
to
escape
one's
situation.
Not
being
able
to
participate
in
the
financial
system
creates
unintended
inequities
that
create
waste
and
result
in
a
net
loss
for
society.
</p>
<p>
However,
some
of
the
shortcomings
of
today's
financial
system
could
be
addressed
via
technological
improvements.
For
example,
there
is
a
considerable
overlap
between
the
unbanked
and
underbanked
population
and
access
to
advanced
mobile
phones
and
the
Web.
By
providing
financial
services
to
people
with
mobile
phones
in
a
standardized
way
via
the
Web,
we
could
see
an
improvement
in
the
financial
health
of
these
individuals
and
their
families.
</p>
<p>
Extending
the
current
financial
system
to
reach
further
helps
an
ever
increasing
number
of
people
plan
for
their
future,
focus
on
the
long-term,
and
thus
contributes
to
a
greater
net
gain
for
society.

An
Overview
of
the
Payment
Phases
</span>
</h2>
<p>
There
are
many
types
of
<a href="#dfn-transaction" class="internalDFN">
transaction
</a>
s
in
the
world
of
payments,
including
person-to-business,
business-to-business,
business-to-person,
government-to-person,
person-to-government,
and
person-to-person.
In
this
document
we
focus
on
the
interactions
between
a
<a href="#dfn-payer" class="internalDFN">
payer
</a>
and
a
<a href="#dfn-payee" class="internalDFN">
payee
</a>,
either
of
which
could
be
a
person,
business,
government,
or
software
agent),
which
we
organize
into
four
phases:

The
group
would
like
feedback
related
to
the
general
structure
of
the
payment
phases
from
individuals
that
worked
on
ISO20022,
ISO12812,
the
European
Payment
Commission,
and
various
X9
documents
to
ensure
that
the
phases
reflect
business
processes
outlined
in
financial
standardization
initiatives.
Feedback
from
the
general
public
is
also
requested
to
see
if
non-payment
professionals
can
navigate
and
understand
the
document
without
prior
payment
industry
knowledge.

<p>
The
descriptions
below
only
discuss
the
interactions
between
the
<a href="#dfn-payer" class="internalDFN">
payer
</a>
and
the
<a href="#dfn-payee" class="internalDFN">
payee
</a>.
We
do
not
expose
the
low-level
exchanges
between
banks,
card
associations,
or
other
back-end
"payment
clearing"
parties
in
a
<a href="#dfn-transaction" class="internalDFN">
transaction
</a>.
Those
details
will
be
discussed
in
the
Interest
Group's
work
on
architecture
and
requirements.
</p>
<p>
Each
phase
below
consists
of
a
series
of
steps.
The
details
of
each
step
vary
by
<a href="#dfn-payment-scheme" class="internalDFN">
payment
scheme
</a>.
Some
steps
may
not
be
relevant
at
certain
times
(e.g.,
depending
on
<a href="#dfn-payment-scheme" class="internalDFN">
payment
scheme
</a>
or
<a href="#dfn-transaction" class="internalDFN">
transaction
</a>
specifics).
For
example,
some
<a title="purchase" href="#dfn-purchase" class="internalDFN">
purchases
</a>
do
not
involve
a
proof
of
funds
or
proof
of
hold.
ACH
and
SEPA
<a title="payment scheme" href="#dfn-payment-scheme" class="internalDFN">
payment
schemes
</a>
generally
do
not
support
the
verification
of
available
funds,
thus
in
these
<a title="payment scheme" href="#dfn-payment-scheme" class="internalDFN">
payment
schemes
</a>
the
particular
proof
of
funds
step
is
skipped.
In
some
cases,
steps
may
happen
in
a
slightly
different
order
than
described
below.
</p>
<p>
It
is
also
important
to
note
that
these
phases
and
steps
may
be
interrupted
at
various
times
(e.g.,
one
party
drops
out,
or
exceptions
occur
like
insufficient
funds
or
a
regulatory
block).
While
these
phases
are
an
approximation
of
the
general
flow
of
all
payments,
they
are
helpful
in
structuring
the
use
cases
such
that
it
is
easy
to
figure
out
to
which
part
of
the
payment
process
a
particular
use
case
belongs.
</p>
<p>
While
these
four
phases
may
apply
more
or
less
well
to
a
variety
of
other
payment
scenarios
such
as
person-to-person
payments,
those
topics
are
not
the
current
focus
of
the
group.
We
plan
to
address
them
directly
in

site
that
provides
a
monthly
analysis
of
the
world
of
finance.
Goals
Improved
user
experience,
Transparency,
and
Automatability.
Motivation
Payers
should
be
able
to
understand
if
a
particular
purchase
is
a
recurring
payment
prior
to
initiating
the
payment.
Registration-less
Some
payees
would
rather
not
require
a
payer
to
register
at
their
site
before
initiating
a
purchase:
Sven
wants
to
view
a
pay
to
read
article
and
does
so
without
needing
to
pre-register
with
the
website.
Reiko
finds
a
blowtorch
for
sale
at
a
local
digital
resale
website
and
places
money
into
escrow
without
needing
to
register
with
the
website.
Benny
is
listening
to
music
in

and
likes

He
initiates
a
purchase
of
the
song
from
the
local
"music
beacon"
without
needing
to
register
with
the
coffee
shop
or
the
music
service.
Goals
Improved
user
experience,
Greater
security,
Innovation,
and
Automatability
Motivation
There
are
a
large
number
of
"paywall"
websites
on
the
Web
that
require
a
customer
to
register
before
they
may
use
the
website.
In
many
cases,
if
the
site
isn't
regularly
visited
by
the
customer,
they
abandon
the
transaction
when
they
see
the
paywall
requirement.
Providing
a
mechanism
to
sell
an
inexpensive
item
to
a
customer
without
requiring
registration
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
not
only
the
merchants
selling
goods
and
services,
but
customers
that
would
like
to
avoid
lengthy
registration
processes.

One
of
the
biggest

flaws

is
that
all
the

<a title="payer" href="#dfn-payer" class="internalDFN">

typically
transmitted
to

For
example,
credit

with
expiration
date,

be
intercepted
by

the

Special
attention
should

to
ensuring

this

isn't
supported
by

For

at
