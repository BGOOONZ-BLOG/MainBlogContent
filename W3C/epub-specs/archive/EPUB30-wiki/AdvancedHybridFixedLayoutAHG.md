# Ad-hoc Group for Advanced/Hybrid Fixed Layout #

# Introduction #

IDPF had a workshop [“Advanced/Hybrid Fixed Layouts in EPUB”](TokyoWorshopForAdvancedHybridFixedLayouts.md).  The [meeting notes](NotesFromAdvancedHybridFixedLayoutWorkshop.md) are available.

It was agreed to start an ad-hoc group for creating charter proposals for one or more new working groups for advanced/hybrid fixed layout.  Markus and Makoto are willing to convene this ad-hoc group.  We propose to finish charter proposals by the end of August, 2012.
