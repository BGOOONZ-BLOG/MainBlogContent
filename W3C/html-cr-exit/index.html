            The goal of this document is to capture the HTML WG's consensus as to the degree of
            testing in some areas of the HTML 5.0 specification, in order satisfy its agreed-upon
            <a href='http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/public-permissive-exit-criteria.html'>exit
            criteria</a>. This document is therefore all about process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The objective is <strong>emphatically not</strong> to provide a roadmap for actual
            test writing. For that purpose, the testing effort's
            <a href='http://w3c-test.org/web-platform-tests/master/tools/coverage/'>coverage
            document</a> is the appropriate source of information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exit criteria allow the group to make a judgement call about which parts of the spec
            need decent tests that can demonstrate sufficient interoperability, and which can be
            considered okay without much of a testing effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general idea is that HTML 5.0 is just one milestone in what is likely to be a
            longish list of further milestones. As such it needs to be an improvement on the past
            and a good stepping stone for the next milestones. In other words, we're not aiming for
            perfection, but we want to avoid making it harder to reach in future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on this plan, the group picked which parts it honestly felt needed addressing as
            opposed to the bits it felt were good enough. "Good enough" is of course a rough metric; 
            we based our assessment on our experience in using given features in development.
          </p>
          <p>
            To put things differently, the goal is two-fold:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reaching Recommendation so that the RF policy can kick in;</li>
            <li>
              Having that milestone, HTML 5.0, be an artefact of sufficient quality for real world
              industrial usage.
            </li>
          </ul>
