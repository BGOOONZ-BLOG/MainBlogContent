            The Web of Things (WoT) Interest Group (IG) is collecting concepts and technologies
            to enable discovery and interoperability of Internet of Things (IoT) services on a
            worldwide basis.
            This document is used to collect IoT use cases from different domains for the Standardisation
            work in the W3C WoT groups.
            The domain use cases are dissaminated to identify so-called 
            <b>building-blocks</b>
            that are common across the different domains as well as 
            <b>non-functional</b> requirements. 
            <br></br>
            The identified 
            <b>building blocks</b> are inputs to the investigation and standardisation work.
            <br></br>
            The technology candidates for the respective 
            <b>building blocks</b> were moved into the

            <section id="building-automation">
               <h2 title="Authored by: dret">Building Automation</h2>
               <p>Buildings often have a large variety of components such as Heating, Venting, and Air
                  Conditioning (HVAC), lighting systems, and possibly more specialized systems such
                  as support for reserving rooms electronically. Very often, these systems are not provided
                  by a single supplier. Instead, landscapes of heterogeneous systems develop over time.
                  Interoperability becomes a paramount challenge, as there should be a single way how
                  interactions with the overall building automation infrastructure are possible. Furthermore,
                  sensors, controllers, and actors of one system serving one specific use case can be
                  useful for other use cases and can also enable new cross-domain applications and services
                  to amplify comfort, security, and operational efficiency in smart buildings.
               </p>
               <p>Building automation scenarios can have layered services,for example when it comes
                  to temperature sensing. While the basic functionality of the system might only include
                  getting information about the current temperature in a variety of places, there might
                  also be a "temperature history" service. This service might allow more advanced features
                  such as accessing the complete history of temperature measurements, and possible even
                  more advanced functionality such as queries in this dataset. By combining available
                  data (e.g. weather forecast and occupancy of meeting rooms), room temperatures and
                  future cooling/heating demand can be predicted to increase (e.g. an office building's)
                  energy efficiency. Again, such an advanced service should be accessible in the same
                  way as the more basic services, so that developers can access all these services in
                  a uniform way.

                           are exposed as part of the building automation system. In such a case, it is necessary
                           that available resources can be described or are describing themselves, preferably
                           using a framework that makes those descriptions uniform even if the underlying sensors
                           or services are using different implementations and communication technologies.

                           it is advantageous for the system to support some kind of push mechanism, so that
                           applications can subscribe to these events and will be notified when they happen.
                           This increases the workload of the building automation system (it has to keep track
                           of subscribers), but may make development of certain classes of applications much
                           easier.

               <p>Each employee in an office building specifies a preference profile (temperature, light
                  setup, table height, ...). Using information from company IDs/badges or smartphones
                  the building can automatically influence the building automation system around individuals
                  based on their current location and preference profile.
               </p>
               <p>Besides an increase of comfort in general, personal profiles can also be used to assist
                  people with special needs. For instance, in case of emergency, the acoustic alarm
                  sirens are insufficient for deaf people. Other mechanisms like flashing lights or
                  mobile device notifications that are available in the person's proximity need to be
                  used.
               </p>
               <p>In case of several people in the same room (e.g. a meeting), mediation is needed.
                  This is also the case in other cross-influenced situations and if overall goals are
                  set to be achieved, such as energy saving.

               <h2 title="Authored by: Dave Raggett">Smart control of washing machine</h2>
               <p>Joan has a heavy load of washing to do. She decides to run it over night to take advantage
                  of the lower power prices. She loads the clothes into the washing machine and selects
                  the economy operation mode. She has previously set her preferences with her home automation
                  agent that is accessible on the Web from her phone, tablet, TV or laptop.
               </p>

               <div>
                  <h4>How does this translate to a technical Description</h4>
                  <p>The physical user controls on the washing machine are deliberately simple, and designed
                     to work in conjunction with the web based home automation agent. This agent has access
                     to Joan’s electricity supplier and as is able to track the price charged by her supplier
                     on her electricity plan as it changes according to demand across the city. The agent
                     runs in the cloud, but is able to communicate through the firewall with devices in
                     Joan’s home via her home hub. This was set up automatically when she first plugged
                     the machine in. The washing machine has a very limited embedded controller. It suffices
                     to run the desired washing and drying cycle, and has sensors that monitor its operation
                     and enable components that are wearing out to be detected before they fail. Joan has
                     agreed to share this data with the manufacturer as part of the warranty agreement.
                     In return, she gets proactive scheduling of service visits at her convenience.

               <p>Many households nowadays use one or more Home Automation service,
                  Demand-Response (DR) service or Security service. For DR subscription
                  and operation, a home gateway device communicates with an aggregator to
                  shed energy use when asked. Home automation, typically also with
                  a home gateway, enables cloud-based monitoring and control of home
                  devices based on pre-defined rules that perform actions based on
                  conditions or triggers such as weather forecast or pushed doorbells.
                  Security services also install sensors and provide cloud-based control
                  of security features such as arming/disarming and monitoring.
               </p>
               <p>There is an increasing need to integrate those discrete services from
                  different vendors harmoniously to increase the total benefit by
                  orchestrating them.

               <p>Katherine prefers to control the comfort of her living environment. 
                  She has an air conditioner at home and  has been using her 
                  smartphone to control it since a controller application on the 
                  smartphone can more precisely control based on her preference 
                  instead of using a remote controller that it comes with.
                  	   Recently she bought a home hub. Now she can use another 
                  feature that can turn on the air conditioner from outside 
                  using the smartphone and the application, just before 
                  arriving at home to prepare a more comfortable room temperature.
                  
               </p>
               <p>Requirements:</p>
               <p>- An application on a smartphone can search devices which can be 
                  controlled both on local network and remote network.
               </p>
               <p>- An application on a smartphone can understand the properties of 
                  discovered devices.
               </p>
               <p>- An application on a smartphone can send commands without caring about
                  the network connection underneath.
               </p>
               <p>Related Building Blocks:</p>
               <p>- Abstracted discovery mechanism that applications can query 
                  usable devices both locally and remotely.

               <h2 title="Authored by: Debbie Dahl">Intelligent Hotel Room </h2>
               <p>Katherine is a frequent business traveler. She stays in a variety of
                  different hotels in many cities and different countries. In each hotel room
                  she is able to control the lighting, heating/air conditioning, locks, alarm
                  clock, water temperature and entertainment in her room. If someone knocks
                  on the door she can see who's there from the TV or from her phone (a
                  security camera is outside her door). Control is available from her mobile
                  device, or she may be able to interact with the hotel room's services
                  through an ambient device located in the room. It is important for user
                  satisfaction for Katherine to get immediate access to these services when
                  she checks in (without installing hotel-specific software), but it's also
                  important that she not have access after she checks out. She doesn't have
                  time to learn a new user interface for every hotel, or even every hotel
                  chain, that she stays in, because she stays in so many different places. 
               </p>
               <p>The user should also be able to control the room remotely through her mobile
                  device; for example, she would like to be able to warm up the room when she
                  is within a half hour or so of arriving back from dinner. This would support
                  energy savings because the room could be colder when no one is there.
                  Similarly, geofencing could also be used to turn on the lights when she's
                  approaching the room. 
               </p>
               <p>The user would also like to have her preferences made known when she checks
                  in. For example, the room should automatically know her preferred room
                  temperature, preferred units (metric vs. imperial), and her preferred
                  language. However, her preferences may have to be overridden by the hotel
                  (for example, if she prefers a temperature that is too high or too low, or
                  if her preferred language is not available). In that case, she needs to be
                  informed that her preferences can't be met and she should be offered
                  alternatives. 
               </p>
               <p>Privacy is also important in this use case. For example, the user doesn't
                  want it to be generally known whether or not she's in the room. Security is
                  important for preventing unauthorized access to the room or its services. 
               </p>
               <p>The user sometimes also shares a hotel room with a colleague, in which case
                  both occupants need to have access to the same capabilities. 
               </p>

                  <p>This use case describes a dynamic configuration where different users are
                     coming and going into the same space. It terms of control it is very similar
                     to a smart home, but the difference is that the occupant of the room changes
                     on a very frequent basis.
                  </p>
                  <p>Discovery is very important so that users' devices can be used to find the
                     hotel room's services and their capabilities. It also points out the
                     importance of:

                  <p>Interoperabiltiy across vendors</p>

               <p>In a factory, the automation function does not run on a large central system, but
                  decision-making is increasingly decentralized, i.e., shifted "downwards" towards the
                  machine or control panels on the shop floor. With the advent of the digitization,
                  the demand for a flexible production in small batch sizes or the production of multi-variant
                  mass products arises in many manufactoring industries. The production process can
                  be adaptive if product memories specify the machining; appropriate paths along the
                  production line can be discovered dynamically.

               <p>Manufacturing plants and process automation plants not only have to be monitored on-site
                  but also from remote locations. That is for example to compare KPI (key performance
                  indicators) of different manufacturing sites and optimization of the production processes
                  and outputs based on the collected data, for diagnosis, remote service support or
                  predictive maintenance.
               </p>
               <p>For such a system you need a platform that collects the data from field level devices,
                  from control level and also from applications on MES level. Applications can connect
                  to the platform to retrieve the data for further processing (e.g., optimization algorithms).
                  The open platform enables the connection between data points provided from devices/applications
                  of different companies to applications from different parties (e.g. software that
                  provides trouble-shooting information combined with online status information of devices

               <p>Continuous condition monitoring of machines and production systems allow an understanding
                  of the current operational performance of a production system. Furthermore, by observing
                  the deterioration of machines or analyzing the causes of defects, typical event patterns
                  and causally determined correlations in more complex systems can be learned and used
                  to predict future maintenance demand. Precise predictions require a large amount of
                  high quality monitoring data in order to achieve the promised aims of reducing the
                  percentage of unplanned maintenance and downtime. Many defects can be diagnosed, and
                  sometimes fixed, remotely if the maintenance service provider accesses historical
                  and live machine data. Furthermore, previous maintenance and repair reports provide
                  useful knowledge to find a solution quickly.

               <p>An efficient maintenance strategy dispatches technicians according to the current
                  maintenance demand, downtime probabilities, available resources, preferences of the
                  machine operator, in conjunction with economic trade-offs. In particular, the dispatching
                  for an optimal maintenance strategy needs to integrate the predicted maintenance demand
                  with various other information sources like skills and experiences of available service
                  technicians, information of installed machines and systems, availability of potentially
                  useful tools and spare parts, time limits of forthcoming production orders, etc.

               <p>An industrial automation systems (IAS) needs to be managed throughout different phases
                  of its lifecycle, e.g., development, engineering, operation, maintenance, optimization,
                  and other phases. The lifecycle management is a challenging task due to various reasons.
                  For instance, it is a task that involves various stakeholders (e.g., domain engineers,
                  software engineers, system engineers, system installers etc.) and hence it is an error-prone
                  task, it is often handled in a safety critical environment, it needs to be maintained
                  over a longer timeframe (during which some of the stakeholders or parts of the system
                  may not be available) and so forth.
               </p>
               <p>Let us consider a use case scenario which, throughout the lifecycle management of
                  an IAS, considers following tasks: Development of a new automation function, service
                  or an app based on available resources and domain knowledge; Support for resource
                  discovery, optimal selection and choreography of resources; Parametrization of resources,
                  functions, services and apps; Support for adaptive services running in a dynamic environment
                  (i.e., physical resources appear and disappear); Monitoring and diagnosis of resources,
                  functions, services and apps; Optimization of automation workflows involving different
                  resources and different lifecycle phases.
               </p>
               <p>From these activities, as found in a typical lifecycle management of an IAS, one can

               <p>A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is an aggregation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs),
                  that can act as an entity on energy markets or as an ancillary service to grid operation.
               </p>
               <p>The individual DERs often have a primary use on their own, with electric generation/consumption
                  being a side-effect resp. secondary use. This results in negotiations/collaborations
                  between many different parties e.g. such as the DER owner, the VPP operator, the grid
                  operator and others.

                  A device, its network environment and the applications
                  installed on the device, need to be managed.  The relevant
                  resources are typically represented in a hierarchical fashion
                  (as modelled in the YANG schema language) and exchanged as
                  collections or as subsets of a larger collection.
                  Some of the resources can be so large that they seriously
                  stress the runtime environment of the device (e.g., for
                  firmware updates).
                  Some of the subresources may appear and disappear dynamically
                  (e.g., network prefixes).  Retrieval and update of the
                  resources may refer to non-contiguous subsets of a hierarchy
                  (PATCH, non-contiguous GET).  Traditional URI-paths may be too
                  expensive for repeated transfer in requests.

                           As importantly, management information needs to be

               <h2 title="Authored by: Edoardo Pignotti">Community-based Flood Monitoring</h2>
               <p>Flood warning systems are often based on blanket reports from local authorities and
                  environment agencies, which are based on, limited resources and a small number of
                  expensive, professional sensors.
               </p>
               <p>If John wants to determine if his property will be affected by water, it needs access
                  to flooding information at a street level and to understand how connected water streams
                  might affect the water level near his property. Such a process requires higher resolution
                  data on the streams, groundwater and complex basins riddling cities and villages.
               </p>
               <p>John is part of a community-based initiative where members provide access to water
                  level data by radio connected low cost sensors in their properties. It is very important
                  for John to understand the quality of the information it has access to in order to
                  make better decisions about what flood defences to use.
               </p>
               <p>Privacy is also am important factor as sensors could be deployed in areas of low-density
                  population and John does not want other people to infer what kind of flood damage
                  his property might have suffered.

               <h2 title="Authored by: claesnilsson">Remote health monitoring system</h2>
               <p>John is retired and lives alone in his own apartment. He has bad legs and there is
                  a constant risk that he falls. If that happens he is not able to rise from the floor
                  without help. In addition, John suffers from heart arrhythmias and diabetes.
               </p>
               <p>Due to John's condition he needs remote monitoring by his healthcare provider. He
                  therefore wears a wristband capable of continuously monitoring his heart rate and
                  detect irregular heart rhythms as well as detecting a fall situation. A future version
                  of the wristband will also be capable of non-invasive monitoring of his blood glucose
                  level. The wristband communicates wirelessly with John's healthcare provider. This
                  remote monitoring system could be seen as a complement to a normal home alarm system
                  for elderly people with which old people can manually call an emergency service. The
                  differences are that the wristband system detects severe conditions automatically,
                  which is needed if the person is confused or is unconscious, and also has the possibility
                  to measure medical parameters such as heart rate and heart rhythm.

                  <h4>How does this translate to a technical Description</h4>
                  <p>When the system is in operation everything works automatically without any user interface.
                     The remote monitoring application runs in a cloud server and can communicate with
                     the wristband. A local router, situated for example in a Smartphone, may be needed
                     to translate between a local communication method such as Bluetooth Low Energy and
                     the mobile network or wifi, but at application level end-to-end security and communication
                     through firewalls are achieved. The communication must be reliable and the power consumption
                     in the wristband low to achieve long battery life.
                  </p>
                  <p>User interaction is only required at system installation. The user, or another trusted
                     person, e.g. a relative, health care personnel or personal assistant, has to use a
                     web browser to log in to the remote monitoring application and the user has to approve
                     that the application has access to his/her wristband using an existing authorization
                     system, e.g. OAuth.
                  </p>
                  <p>To provide service discovery for applications the wristband, during the system installation,
                     is registered in a discovery service that contains a service description for the wristband.
                     This service description states for example manufacturer, owner and the APIs to access
                     the resources of the wristband.

                  visiting Imani who has been complaining of weakness and chest pains.  Ebele uses her
                  mobile phone to consult the doctor who is a clinic in a town eighty kilometers away.
                  The doctor asks her to perform an ECG on Imani. She attaches the electrodes to Imani's
                  chest and plugs them into the remote ECG monitor. This streams the data in real time
                  over the mobile network to the clinic where the doctor is based. The doctor examines
                  the ECG and spots signs of arrythmia, and directs Ebele to put Imani on a course of
                  medication.

                  <h4>How does this translate to a technical Description?</h4>
                  <p>The remote ECG monitor has a multichannel signal processing board that combines the
                     readings from the electrodes to generate a clean analog output.  This is fed to the
                     ADC in a microcontroller, which streams the digitised samples over the mobile network
                     to a server in the clinic. The data is then forwarded to the doctor's terminal for
                     analysis.

                  <p>This use case involves a means to model streams as a complex data type for the description
                     language for "things". In this particular use case, the stream consists of 24 bit
                     values at a sampling rate of 300 per second.

            <h2>Resource Description</h2>
            <p>In loosely coupled systems, applications may encounter resources they have no prior
               knowledge about. Resource Description is a facility that allows resources to be described
               or describe themselves, so that applications can use those descriptions to learn about
               certain properties and/or capabilities of a resource. Resource descriptions on the
               highest abstraction level needs to provide two main facilities: identification of
               resources through some referencing mechanism, and description of resources through
               some data model.

            <h2>Content-Negotiation</h2>
            <p>For many interactions, it is necessary that peers agree on a shared data exchange
               format. There are various ways in which such a format can be defined, and in which
               agreement can be reached, but the general goal for all of these cases is that peers
               can reach agreement on which data exchange to use, and what it means to use this format.
               Depending on the type of data to be exchanged, different data exchange formats have
               different advantages and disadvantages, but generally speaking, the most important
               factor is that there is agreement on the representation of the data to be exchanged,
               and how to parse that into a model that is usable and useful for the application's
               goals.

               between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as
               a “triple”). Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data
               to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications. This linking structure
               forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between
               two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This graph view is the easiest possible
               mental model for RDF and is often used in easy-to-understand visual explanations.

                        </b>RDF's origins (as highlighted by its name) are in the field of providing metadata
                        (i.e., descriptions) of Web resources. This is facilitated by using URIs as identifiers,
                        and by using attribute/value pairs that make statements about those URI-identified
                        resources. RDF descriptions can be of arbitrary complexity by joining triples to form
                        a graph, and they can use and combine various vocabularies so that the graph contains
                        information according to the concepts defined in those vocabularies.

            </h2>
            <p>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an application profile of
               the Extensible Markup Language (XML) that enables the near-real-time exchange of structured
               yet extensible data between any two or more network entities. This document defines
               XMPP's core protocol methods: setup and teardown of XML streams, channel encryption,
               authentication, error handling, and communication primitives for messaging, network
               availability ("presence"), and request-response interactions.

            <p>EXI is a very compact representation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information
               Set that is intended to simultaneously optimize performance and the utilization of
               computational resources. The EXI format uses a hybrid approach drawn from the information
               and formal language theories, plus practical techniques verified by measurements,
               for entropy encoding XML information. Using a relatively simple algorithm, which is
               amenable to fast and compact implementation, and a small set of datatype representations,
               it reliably produces efficient encodings of XML event streams.
