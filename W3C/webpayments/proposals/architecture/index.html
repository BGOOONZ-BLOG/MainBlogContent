    <p>The mission of the Web Payments Working Group is to make payments easier and more secure on the Web.</p>

    <p>The group is chartered to develop multiple technologies. This document describes an architecture and a set
        of roles in that architecture that, together, facilitate the group's mission.</p>

    <p>This intentionally describes components by their role, acknowledging that different implementations
        may result in multiple roles being adopted by a single system component. No specifics are defined about how
        the functions of each role will be fulfilled beyond the internal algorithms that each must execute. Specific
        interfaces may be described in detail in accompanying documents that define how these roles are implemented
        in those contexts.</p>

    <p class="note">This architecture is focused on the interactions between a payer and payee on the Web and does not
        cover the architecture or components required for the full end to end payment process.</p>
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
    <p>
        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
    </p>

    <p>
        This specification was derived from
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/wiki/A-Payments-Initiation-Architecture-for-the-Web">A Payments
            Initiation Architecture for the Web</a>.

    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Improve the payment experience for payers</h3>

        <p>Payments on the Web today are very payee-centric. The entire payment process is driven by the payee, usually
            an online merchant, who presents the user with one or more ways to pay. In the majority of cases the user
            provides a static credential (such as the details of a credit card) back to the merchant or is redirected
            to a digital wallet service where they approve the transaction.</p>

        <p>Unless the user is able to find a digital wallet that is supported by all of the payee's they wish to pay
            they will never have a standardized payment experience and the majority of the time that experience is
            driven by the payee.</p>

        <p>Further, there is no standardized mechanism to establish a bi-directional channel of communication between the
            payer (or their service provider) and the payee (or their service provider) which could be used to exchange
            payment details and credentials in a more secure manner or negotiate the use of an entirely new payment
            method.</p>

        <p>To remedy this one-sided situation this architecture proposes a new standardized component, the
            <a>payment app</a>, that is used by the payer to handle payment requests.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Protect payer privacy</h3>

        <p>Facilitating an autonomous process for matching the payment methods that the payer supports with those that
            the payee supports seems trivial on the surface, however it is also important to ensure that the
            architecture doesn't allow for user data to be leaked to the payee system.</p>

        <p>To protect the payer's privacy the architecture defines the role of a <a>payment mediator</a> that sits
            between the payer and payee mediating the initial handshake between them and connecting the requesting
            payee system with an appropriate payer payment app.</p>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>

    <p>In this document we use the following terms with the implied definition as stated below:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Payer</dt>
        <dd>A <dfn data-lt="payer|payers">payer</dfn> is implied to mean any system operated by (or on behalf of) the
            payer. This includes systems operated by the payer's payment services provider.
        </dd>
        <dt>Payee</dt>
        <dd>A <dfn data-lt="payee|payees">payee</dfn> is implied to mean any system operated by (or on behalf of) the
            payee. This includes systems operated by the payee's payment services provider.
        </dd>
        <dt>Payment Request</dt>
        <dd>A <dfn data-lt="payment request|payment requests">payment request</dfn> is a request from a payee to be paid.
            It contains the details of <em>what</em> to pay and <em>how</em> the payment can be made. <em>How</em> the
            payment can be made is specified as a list of <a>payment method identifiers</a>. The payment request MUST
            contain all of the <a>payment method data</a> required for each <a>payment method</a> identified in it's set
            of <em>supported payment methods</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Payment Response</dt>
        <dd>A <dfn data-lt="payment response|payment responses">payment response</dfn> is a response to a payment request
            (normally the result of processing by a payment app). The content of a payment response will be dependant on
            <em>how</em> the payment is being processed.
        </dd>
        <dt>Payment App</dt>
        <dd>A <a>payment app</a> is a component that fulfills the conformance
            criteria specified for a <a>payment app</a> in this specification.
        </dd>
        <dt>Payment Mediator</dt>
        <dd>A <a>payment mediator</a> is a component that fulfills the
            conformance criteria specified for a <a>payment mediator</a> in this specification.

        <dd>A <dfn data-lt="payment method|payment methods">payment method</dfn> defines <em>how</em> a payment request
            must be processed. It defines the format and content of the payment request and payment response messages
            that are exchanged with a payment app. A <a>payment app</a> must be able to process <a>payment requests</a>
            for one or more payment methods.

        <dt>Payment Method Data</dt>
        <dd><a>Payment requests</a> and <a>payment responses</a> have a limited set of data elements that are common to
            all payments, irrespective of the payment method. However <a>payment methods</a> can define additional

                A <a>payment app</a> MUST behave as described in this specification

    <h2>Payment Request Flow</h2>

    <p>The flow of a payment request is shown in the diagram below:</p>
    <img src="flow.png"/>

    <p>In this flow, any system or system component playing the role of <a>payment app</a> or <a>payment mediator</a> is
        assumed to be controlled by the <a>payer</a>. The <a>payment request</a> originates from the <a>payee</a> and is
        always processed first by a <a>payment mediator</a>.</p>

    <p>It's quite possible that a single component may fulfil both roles or even that the system only supports a single
        <a>payment app</a>, which is always used by default, and therefor the role of the <a>payment mediator</a> is
        reduced to simply proxying the request and response between the payee system and the <a>payment app</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Payment Methods</h2>

    <p>Each <a>payment app</a> will support one or more <a>payment methods</a>. A payment method is a system and
        set of rules for processing a <a>payment request</a>. This architecture is designed to support the broadest
        possible array of payment methods. When a payee accepts a given payment method, the assumption is that the
        payee will know how to process the <a>payment method data</a> returned by the <a>payment app</a> for that payment
        method.</p>

    <p>Each payment method is identified by a <a>payment method identifier</a>. The <a>payment mediator</a> compares
        <a>payment method identifiers</a> in the <a>payment request</a> to those, known to be <em>enabled</em> in the
        available <a>payment apps</a> to determine which <a>payment apps</a> to offer the payer to use to process the
        <a>payment request</a>.</p>
    <p><a>Payment method identifiers</a> support distributed extensibility, meaning that there is not a central
        machine-readable registry to discover or register <a>payment methods</a>. Rather, any person or entity can
        define a new <a>payment method</a> as long as they publish a <a>payment method specification</a> that defines:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>How a <a>payment app</a> should process a <a>payment request</a>.</li>
        <li>What <a>payment method data</a> is expected to be included in the request.</li>
        <li>What <a>payment method data</a> is expected to be included in the response.</li>
        <li>What <a>payment method identifiers</a> identify this payment method.</li>
    </ol>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Roles</h2>

    <p>
        The following are the key roles within this architecture.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h3>Payment App</h3>

        <p>A <a>payment app</a> is a component able to process a payment request and return a payment response. Banks,
            merchants, mobile operators, and anyone else who wants to, will make these available. User agents are also
            likely to take on the role of a payment app, storing payment related information on behalf of the user,
            as they already do today with passwords, and using this to process certain payment requests. It is expected
            that payment apps will increase security and privacy by giving users more control over what they share over
            the network. Payment apps will distinguish themselves through the features and services they provide beyond
            the required capabilities described here, for example by offering strong user authentication, loyalty
            program integration, back-channel communications with the merchant for fraud analytics, and so on.</p>

        <p>Payment apps should be implementable on desktops, mobile devices, televisions, embedded devices and other
            devices and operating systems. Payment apps may even be implemented in contexts where they do not have direct
            access to the Web since they payment app receives payment requests from the <a>payment mediator</a>.</p>

        <p>As part of processing a payment request, a payment app MAY render a user interface and/or take advantage of one or
            more other IO channels for payer or third-party interaction (e.g., with a payment service provider). In some
            cases, and where supported by a payment method, a payment app may be able to facilitate a payment without
            immediate user interaction based on prior payer consent. (Example: A Web of Things scenario where the payer
            is a machine capable of executing payments in accordance with predefined rules and logic).</p>

        <p>The composition of a payment app will be platform and deployment dependent and many aspects of how the
            payment app communicates with the host platform, interacts with the payer and payee, and communicates with
            third-party services will be determined by the implementer who provides the execution environment for the
            app, the channels supported by the chosen payment method and the capabilities of the payment mediator,
            that mediates interactions between the payment app and the payee.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Supported vs Enabled Payment Methods</h3>

            <p><a>Payment apps</a> support one or more <a>payment methods</a>. Support for a payment method implies that
                the app SHOULD be able to process a <a>payment request</a> that conforms to the rules defined in the
                <a>payment method specification</a> for that payment method and SHOULD be able to return a valid
                <a>payment response</a>.
            </p>

            <p>However, sometimes an app will be <em>designed</em> to support a specific payment method but the app will
                not have been <em>configured</em> to process payments using that payment method. This may be due to some
                <a>payment method data</a> that the payer needs to configure such as a user credential or payment
                instrument details. In that case the <a>payment app</a> is said to <em>support</em> the payment
                method but that payment method is not <em>enabled</em>.
            </p>

            <p>For example, a <a>payment app</a> may be capable of processing a basic credit card payment that simply
                returns the card details in the payment response. Unless the user has configured the payment app with
                the card details or is able to provide these at the time of processing, that method is not
                <em>enabled</em>.
            </p>

            <p>If a payment app defines a payment method as <code>enabled</code> then it MUST be able to process any
                payment request that lists that that payment method as supported and is formatted correctly according
                to the <a>payment method specification</a> for that payment method.
            </p>

            <p><a>Payment mediators</a> should only consider <code>enabled</code> payment methods when evaluating if a
                <a>payment app</a> is appropriate to process a given payment request.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
                The following algorithms must be implemented by all conforming <a>payment apps</a>:
            </p>
            <section>
                <h4>Processing Payment Requests</h4>
                <p>The most important capability of a <a>payment app</a> is it's ability to process a <a>payment request</a>
                    and return a valid <a>payment response</a>.</p>
                <p>The <dfn>steps for processing a <a>payment request</a></dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The
                    algorithm takes a valid <a>payment request</a> (<var>request</var>) as input and returns a valid

                    to a <a>payment app</a> it must know which <a>payment methods</a> are <em>enabled</em> in that app.</p>
                <p>
                    The payment app MUST provide a mechanism for external components to

                <p>
                    A payment app should implement a mechanism for <dfn>selecting a payment method</dfn> which takes as
                    input a list of <a>payment method identifiers</a> and returns a single <a>payment method identifier</a>.
                    This mechanism MAY include user input, selection based on a custom algorithm or even configured
                    defaults.</p>

                <h4>Performing Payment Method Specific Processing</h4>
                <p>
                    A payment app that claims to have a particular <a>payment method</a> <em>enabled</em> must provide a
                    mechanism for <dfn>performing payment method specific processing</dfn> for that <a>payment method</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The input to this process will be a complete <a>payment request</a> and the <a>payment method identifier</a>
                    of the <a>payment method</a> that should be used to process the request. The <a>payment app</a> SHOULD
                    expect the request to contain any <a>payment method data</a> required to complete the processing of the
                    request.

                <p>
                    The specific behaviour of the <a>payment app</a> during this processing MAY include
                    user interaction or communication with other systems or components. This will be defined, either
                    explicitly or implicitly, in the appropriate <a>payment method specification</a>. The payment app
                    MUST return a <a>payment response</a> that contains the appropriate <a>payment method data</a> for the
                    <a>payment method</a> identified by the <a>payment method identifier</a> passed as input to the process.

        <h3>Payment Mediator</h3>
        <p>The <a>payment mediator</a> sits between the payee's system and the payer's payment app(s) and performs a
            number of functions:</p>
        <ol>

                It determines which <a>payment apps</a> can be used to fulfill a payment request given the payee's
                accepted payment methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                It helps the payer choose one (typically with explicit interaction or prior consent).
            </li>
            <li>
                It passes the <a>payment request</a> from the payee to the to the payer's selected payment app and
                passes the <a>payment response</a> from the payment app back to the payee.

                <h4>Filtering for capable Payment Apps</h4>
                <p>A <a>payment mediator</a>, upon receiving a <a>payment request</a> must compare the set of
                    <a>payment methods</a> supported by the payee (as defined in the <a>payment request</a>) with the
                    set of <a>payment methods</a> <em>enabled</em> in all available <a>payment apps</a> to which it has
                    access and produce a list of <a>payment apps</a> that should be capable of processing the
                    request.</p>
                <p>The <dfn>steps for getting a list of capable payment apps</dfn> are given by the following algorithm.
                    The algorithm takes a valid <a>payment request</a> (<var>request</var>) and the set of
                    <a>payment apps</a> to which it is able to pass the <a>payment request</a> (<var>apps</var>) as
                    input and returns a set of <a>payment method identifiers</a>.</p>
