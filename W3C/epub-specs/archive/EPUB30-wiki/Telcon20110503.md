## epub:switch ##
[Issue 94](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=94)

_Summary:_
  * requiredModule attribute is dropped
  * requiredNamespace attribute now contains any URI identifier (thus we use same approach as svg:switch)
  * use of css to implement not mandated, but an HTML5 processing model is required: _must be processed as if @hidden was set on all but one child_ (see [processing](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-switch-processing))
  * do not create a list of URIs to identify features/extensions now


  * [new spec draft](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-content-switch)
  * [Thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/48ac936115930a3c)

[latest thread (with Teds email from today at the end)](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/cc200645f952f6e6)

_if time allows_
  * drop [text-trim](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-css-text)? (no longer in w3c editors draft)
  * open remark: name for value 'right' in [epub-ruby-position](http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-css-ruby-position) (needs Fantasai and/or Ishii-san).  'inter-character', 'inter-base'.
