[DRAFT] Web Annotation is a W3C a Recommendation
------------------------------------------------

Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,

I am pleased to announce the advancement of the following documents to Recommendations:

Web Annotation Data Model
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-annotation-model-20170123/

Web Annotation Vocabulary
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-annotation-vocab-20170123/

Web Annotation Protocol
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-annotation-protocol-20170123/

The three new standards describe how to precisely identify the target, body and metadata of an annotation of a Web resource. They provide a basic data structure and protocol to ensure interoperability among annotation systems.

All Members who responded to the Call for Review [1] of the Proposed Recommendation showed support, with several reviewers indicating that they produce or expect to produce products that use this specification.

Please join us in congratulating the W3C Data on the Web Annotation Working Group Working Group [2] on this achievement.

This announcement follows section 7.1.2 [3] of the W3C Process Document.

Thank you,

For Tim Berners-Lee, Director, and
Philippe Le HÃ©garet, Project Management Lead;
Xueyuan Jia, W3C Marketing & Communications
