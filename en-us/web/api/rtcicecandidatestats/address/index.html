<p>The <strong><code>address</code></strong> property of the {{domxref(“RTCIceCandidateStats”)}} dictionary indicates the address of the {{Glossary(“ICE”)}} candidate. While it’s preferred that the address be specified as an IPv4 or IPv6 numeric address, a fully-qualified domain name can be used as well.</p>
<p>When a domain name is specified, the first IP address selected for that address is used, even if the domain name maps to multiple IP addresses.</p>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">candidateAddress <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">rtcIceCandidateStats</span>.<span class="at">address</span><span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>Either an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a fully-qualified domain name, which corresponds to the candidate.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the value of <code>address</code> is comprised entirely of digits from 0-9 with periods as separators, the value is interpreted as an IPv4 address.</li>
<li>If the value is entirely comprised of hexadecimal digits and colon (“:”) characters, it is interpreted as an IPv6 address.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the <code>address</code> is presumed to be a fully-qualified domain name, which is resolved first using an AAAA record (assuming IPv6 is available), then using an A record (if no result is found or the device onlu supports IPv4). If multiple IP addresses are returned in response to the query, the {{Glossary(“user agent”)}} selects one, which is then used for the duration of ICE processing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-notes">Usage notes</h2>
<p>The <code>address</code> property was previously known as <code>ip</code>, and only permitted IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to be used. The addition of support for fully-qualified domain names to be used for the address brought about the renaming of the property.</p>
