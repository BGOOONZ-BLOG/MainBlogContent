## Previous minutes ##
Accept [previous minutes](MeetingMinutes100721.md)?

## Previous action item review ##
  * Everybody to start reviewing sub-group requirements

## EPUB-HTML5 relations ##
Decision last week was to go with "Solution B" from: [TextContent\_HTML5Relations](TextContent_HTML5Relations.md) with an optional/desired "late binding" to then-current HTML5 specifications.  That is, if target specifications were "solid" at the time of our publication we would reference those elements in their native HTML5 namespace, rather than pulling them into ours as is suggested by "Solution B."

## Review and prioritization process overview, next steps ##
  * All should start reviewing sub-group requirements
  * Sub-group coordinators should take first prioritization pass
  * Process discussion
  * We should now annotate all interdependencies (implementation proposals must be built with collaboration between interedependent groups)

## Subgroup status report ##
Sub-group coordinators should:
  * Enumerate any requirements that should be given special review attention
  * Enumerate any groups/pairs of requirements that may be in conflict or need to be balanced
  * Raise any issues
  * Present any area for which current requirements seem to the lacking
  * Provide an early summary of going-forward implementation/development plans
