# W3C Web of Things - scripting API deliverable

This directory is the work area of the Task force for a common scripting API for the Web of Things.

## Structure

The directory contains these contents:

* A directory [`proposals`](./proposals/) for discussion inputs and strawman-level examples. Use this directory to file your use cases and API proposals about a part or the full functionality of the WoT Scripting API.
* A directory [`use-cases`](./use-cases) which may contain multiple files for different types of use case sets and recurring patterns, a.k.a. "atomic" use cases. Also, it contains a [`README.md`](./use-cases/README.md) file that summarizes the use cases.
* A directory [`api`](./api) containing the current consensus about the API, based on compiled input from [`proposals`](./proposals/), perhaps expressed in multiple languages or pseudo-languages (e.g. WebIDL, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc). Also, it contains a [`README.md`](./api/README.md) file that summarizes the API. It will be also linked from [`current-practices`](../current-practices).

### Contributing

We mainly use Github issues for discussion. Please use the [*Scripting*](https://github.com/w3c/wot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AScripting) label for API related issues. File issues, comment on existing issues, review pull requests. Fork the repository, add your proposals, and make a pull request.

For email discussions the [public-wot-ig](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/) mailing list is used. Please mark scripting API related emails with the `[scripting]` prefix in the subject line.
