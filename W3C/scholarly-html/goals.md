# GOALS

This list of goals for Scholarly HTML (SH) has been extracted from the discussions in the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-scholarlyhtml/). These goals should be prioritised according to their importance (the current order is merely a draft).

1. SH should support interchange
1. SH documents shall be easy to create by hand
1. Each element in SH should be bound to a particular structural semantics
1. It shall be easy to write programs which process SH documents
1. The number of optional features in SH is to be kept to the absolute minimum
1. SH documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear
1. The SH design should be prepared quickly
1. Supporting existing formats, authoring tools, and pipelines in producing/processing SH
1. SH is defined atop the DOM, with no reference to syntax or encoding
1. The SH spec should include a section with considerations for stringent interoperability and long-term archival that has stricter rules on syntax and encoding

 Our high-level goals were:

    Uncompromisingly enabling structured metadata, accessibility, and internationalisation.
    Pragmatically working in Web browsers, even if it occasionally incurs some markup overhead.
    Powerfully customisable for inclusion in arbitrary Web sites, while remaining easy to process and interoperable.
    Entirely built on top of open, royalty-free standards.
    Long-term viability as a data format.

Additionally, in view of the specific problem we addressed, in the creation of this vernacular we have favoured the reliability of interchange over ease of authoring; but have nevertheless attempted to cater to the latter as much as possible.
