## Transportation ##

### Air ###
The closest two airports are San Francisco International (SFO) and Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC).  Either is fine.

The other area airport, Oakland (OAK), is less convenient for this meeting.


### Ground ###
For Car service, we use Deep Limo.  http://www.deeplimo.com/
Quick and reliable cab service:  Yellow Checker Cab (408) 777-7777
Although there are plenty of taxis at either airport.

Cost of Taxi between SFO and Palo Alto should be around $60 (USD).


### Rail ###
The closest CalTrain stop is the Palo Alto stop which is 8 blocks to the west of the meeting and a leisurely 15 minute walk


## Lodging ##
We have used all of these, and any of them are fine.  I would suggest the Garden Court because of proximity.
