<p>{{APIRef(“Device Orientation Events”)}}</p>
<p>The <strong><code>accelerationIncludingGravity</code></strong> property returns the amount of acceleration recorded by the device, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_per_second_squared">meters per second squared (m/s²)</a>. Unlike {{DOMxRef(“DeviceMotionEvent.acceleration”)}} which compensates for the influence of gravity, its value is the sum of the acceleration of the device as induced by the user and an acceleration equal and opposite to that caused by gravity. In other words, it measures the {{interwiki(“wikipedia”, “G-Force”, “g-force”)}}. In practice, this value represents the raw data measured by an {{interwiki(“wikipedia”, “accelerometer”)}}.</p>
<p>This value is not typically as useful as {{DOMxRef(“DeviceMotionEvent.acceleration”)}}, but may be the only value available on devices that aren’t able to remove gravity from the acceleration data, such as on devices that don’t have a gyroscope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>accelerationIncludingGravity</code>’s name can be misleading. This property represents acceleration including <em>the effects of</em> gravity. For example, if a device is lying flat on a horizontal surface with the screen pointing up, gravity would be -9.8 along the Z axis, while <code>acceleration.z</code> would be 0 and <code>accelerationIncludingGravity.z</code> would be 9.8. Similarly, if a device is in free fall with its screen horizontal and pointing up, gravity would be -9.8 along the Z axis, while <code>acceleration.z</code> would be -9.8 and <code>accelerationIncludingGravity.z</code> would be 0.</p>

<p>The <code>accelerationIncludingGravity</code> property is an object providing information about acceleration on three axis. Each axis is represented with its own property:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x</code>
<ul>
<li>: Represents the acceleration upon the x axis which is the west to east axis</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>y</code>
<ul>
<li>: Represents the acceleration upon the y axis which is the south to north axis</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>z</code>
<ul>
<li>: Represents the acceleration upon the z axis which is the down to up axis</li>
</ul></li>
