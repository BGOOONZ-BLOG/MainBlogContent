# Requirements Guidelines #

## Follow the consistent form ##
Unique, numbered title; requirements statement; rationale and/or use cases. Additional comments and clarifications can be added where necessary.

## Qualifying the requirement ##

### Tie-back to charter ###
Ensure a clear tie-back from each requirement to industry problem(s) being addressed per the charter, or if none, state this. This may be done via organization of sets of requirements within a subgroup requirements statement. What may seem obvious to an expert working in a particular subgroup may not be obvious to other WG members, so err on the side of being explicit about the connections.

### Use cases and rationale ###
Qualify the requirement with either at least one use case description, or (in "rationale") an inline problem description or a reference to an atomic issue (such as the future direction issues from the maintenance WG). Use case descriptions are extra important when the requirement pertains to a _revolutionary_ feature.

### Maximize use of examples and scenarios ###
Maximize use of examples and scenarios - link to specific EPUB files or files in other formats where appropriate, and/or provide clear examples of types of publications or uses that would exhibit the requirement. This is particularly important for requirements having to do with improvements in expressivity and/or efficiency: if it is posited to be a priority to improve something, there should be clear example(s)/use case(s) showing how the unimproved capability falls short. Any requirement without example(s)/use case(s) will be considered of lower priority.

## Avoid presupposing technical solutions ##
Avoid presupposing a specific technical solution to the problem being addressed by the requirement. There may be multiple technical solutions to the same problem; it is not the role of a requirement to list these, nor to express preferences among them. Focus on specifying the feature or function that is needed, and why. The listing and selection of solutions is done in a distinct phase that follows the requirements gathering.

## Prioritization scheme ##
The following scheme is referred to as _The Conboy grading system_:

A - High priority, within charter scope

B - Medium priority, within charter scope

C - Low priority, within charter scope

D - High priority, outside of charter scope

E - Medium priority, outside of charter scope

F - Low priority, outside of charter scope
