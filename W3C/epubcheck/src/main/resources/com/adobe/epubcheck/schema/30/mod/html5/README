The modules in this directory are part of the schema that defines 
a vocabulary and grammar for EPUB3 XHTML Content Documents [1], 
based on W3C HTML [2], with EPUB extensions. 

The modules are derived from the schemas used in the Nu Html Checker [3],
up-to-date with commit d00d51a585175f09c67c150aeb6891d3695bfebf

The file `epubcheck.patch` was created when first importing the HTML schemas,
to document how the type system was adapted. It is not intended to be applied
automatically as a patch file.
