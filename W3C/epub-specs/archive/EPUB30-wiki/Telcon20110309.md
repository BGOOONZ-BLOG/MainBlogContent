## OCF Issues ##

[Wiki page for status of changes per Murata's groups comments](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/OCFFeedback)

### renditions and de-generalization ###
  * define "rendition" [1.1](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/OCFFeedback#1.1)
  * rendition requirements
    * Currently: An OCF Container may contain 0-n EPUBs. (see also [Issue 60](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=60))
  * better def of "default rendition"
    * Currently in 3.5.1: "An OCF Processor should consider the first rootfile element within the rootfiles element to be the default rendition for the contained publication."

### ODF relations ###

### Schemas ###
  * clarify usage of foreign elements and attributes in container.xml (add nvdl, or restrict using rng:anyName, or remove support for this entirely)
  * do we need NVDL for enc and sig schemas (includes the anyName pattern already?)
  * [Customized schema for font embedding?](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/OCFFeedback#Appendix_A)
