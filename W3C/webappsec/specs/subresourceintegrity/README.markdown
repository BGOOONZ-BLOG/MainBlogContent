Subresource Integrity
=====================

Editor's draft: https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/subresourceintegrity/

The spec text is written in the [Kramdown variant of Markdown][kramdown].
After editing `spec.markdown`, you can generate a new HTML draft by typing
`make` on the command line.

You can publish a new draft by typing `make publish` (which simply pushes
the local `master` branch to GitHub's `gh-pages` branch).

Pull requests happily reviewed.
