<p>This is the <strong>4th step</strong> out of 16 of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser">Gamedev Phaser tutorial</a>. You can find the source code as it should look after completing this lesson at <a href="https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Phaser-Content-Kit/blob/gh-pages/demos/lesson04.html">Gamedev-Phaser-Content-Kit/demos/lesson04.html</a>.</p>
<p>We have our blue ball printed on screen, but it’s doing nothing — It would be cool to make it move somehow. This article covers how to do just that.</p>
<h2 id="updating-the-balls-position-on-each-frame">Updating the ball’s position on each frame</h2>
<p>Remember the <code>update()</code> function and its definition? The code inside it is executed on every frame, so it’s a perfect place to put the code that will update the ball’s position on screen. Add the following new lines of the code inside <code>update()</code>, as shown:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">update</span>() <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">    <span class="va">ball</span>.<span class="at">x</span> <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">    <span class="va">ball</span>.<span class="at">y</span> <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4"><span class="op">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>The code above adds 1 to the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties representing the ball coordinates on the canvas, on each frame. Reload index.html and you should see the ball rolling across the screen.</p>

<p>You can check the finished code for this lesson in the live demo below, and play with it to understand better how it works:</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>The next step is to add some basic collision detection, so our ball can bounce off the walls. This would take several lines of code — a significantly more complex step than we have seen so far, especially if we want to add paddle and brick collisions too — but fortunately Phaser allows us to do this much more easily than if we wanted to use pure JavaScript.</p>
<p>In any case, before we do all that we will first introduce Phaser’s <a href="/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser/Physics">physics</a> engines, and do some setup work.</p>
