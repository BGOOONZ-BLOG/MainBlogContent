         <h1>About the Techniques</h1>

         <p>The accessibility techniques described in this document are advisory in nature. They are intended to help
               <a>Authors</a> create <a>EPUB Publications</a> that conform to the requirements in [[EPUBAccessibility]], but
            they are not all applicable in all situations and there may be other ways to meet the requirements of that
            specification. As a result, this document should not be read as providing prescriptive requirements.</p>

         <p>These techniques also do not address issues in digital publishing for which no universally accessible solutions
            exist. The W3C's Digital Publishing Interest Group has published a note that outlines many of these issues
            [[DPUB-Accessibility]]. As solutions become available, they will be incorporated into the appropriate document,
            whether this one or one it refers to.</p>

         <p>If Authors encounter issues that are not covered in these or related techniques, they are encouraged to report
            the issue to the appropriate community for guidance on how to meet accessibility standards. The <a
               href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/">W3C Web Accessibility Interest Group</a> has a public mailing list where
            issues meeting [[WCAG20]] and [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] requirements can be raised. The IDPF similarly has an <a
               href="http://idpf.org/forums/epub-accessibility">accessibility forum</a> where EPUB-related issues can be
            raised.</p>

         <h1>Discovery Metadata Techniques</h1>

         <section class="suppress-numbering" id="meta-001">
            <h2>META-001: Identify primary access modes</h2>

            <p>An access mode is defined as a "human sense perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a user may
               process or perceive the content of a digital resource." [[ISO24751-3]] For example, if an <a>EPUB
                  Publication</a> contains images and video, visual perception is required to consume the content exactly as
               it was created.</p>

            <p>There are four access modes that are typically specified for EPUB Publications:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p><strong>textual</strong> — the publication contains text content (headings, paragraphs, etc.).</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p><strong>visual</strong> — the publication contains visual content such as images, graphics, diagrams,
                     animations and video.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p><strong>auditory</strong> — the publication contains auditory content such as standalone audio clips and
                     audio soundtracks for video content.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p><strong>tactile</strong> — the publication contains tactile content such as embedded braille and tactile
                     diagrams.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>

            <p>In order for a user to determine whether an EPUB Publication is suitable for their needs, they need to know
               which of these access modes are required to consume the content. List all applicable access modes in the
                  [[schema.org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessMode"><code>accessMode</code> property</a>, repeating the
               property for each applicable mode.</p>

            <aside class="example">
               <p>The following example shows the metadata entries for an EPUB 3 Publication that has textual and visual
                  access modes.</p>
               <pre>&lt;meta property="schema:accessMode"&gt;textual&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="schema:accessMode"&gt;visual&lt;/meta&gt;</pre>
            </aside>

            <p>Note that the access modes of the content do not reflect any adaptations that have been provided. For example,
               if a comic book also includes alternative text for each image, it does not have a textual access mode. See the
               following section on <a href="#meta-002">sufficient access modes</a> for how to indicate that the available
               adaptations allow the content to be consumed in another mode.</p>

            <p>Refer to the <a href="https://schema.org/accessMode"><code>accessMode</code></a> definition in [[schema.org]]
               for more information about this property and its values.</p>

         </section>

         <section class="suppress-numbering" id="meta-002">
            <h2>META-002: Identify sufficient access modes</h2>

            <p>The access modes sufficient to consume an <a>EPUB Publication</a> express a broader picture of the potential
               usability than do the <a href="#meta-001">basic access modes</a>. Where the basic access modes identify the
               default nature of the media used in the publication, sufficient access modes identify which modes, or sets of
               modes, a user requires to read the publication. Sufficient access modes take into account the affordances and
               adaptations that have been provided, allowing a user to determine whether the content will be usable
               regardless of its default nature.</p>

            <p>Sufficient access modes are identified in the [[schema.org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"
                     ><code>accessModeSufficient</code> property</a>. Repeat the property for each set of sufficient access
               modes.</p>

            <p>For example, consider an EPUB Publication that contains graphics and charts, as well as descriptions for all
               these images. The publication has both textual and visual content, so the <a>Author</a> will include the
               following metadata entries to indicate this:</p>

            <div class="example">
               <pre>&lt;meta property="schema:accessMode"&gt;textual&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="schema:accessMode"&gt;visual&lt;/meta&gt;</pre>
            </div>

            <p>This metadata does not make clear whether a textual access mode is sufficient to read the entire publication,
               or whether a visual one is, only that two modes are required by default. This discrepancy is why sufficiency
               is also important to know.</p>

            <p>The first set of sufficiency metadata the Author inputs will establish the textual and visual requirement:</p>

            <div class="example">
               <pre>&lt;meta property="schema:accessModeSufficient"&gt;textual,visual&lt;/meta&gt;</pre>
            </div>

            <p>The order in which the access modes are listed is not important. The only requirement is that they be
               separated by commas.</p>

            <p>Since the Author has also included descriptions for all the images, she can also indicate that a purely
               textual access mode is sufficient to read the content:</p>

            <div class="example">
               <pre>&lt;meta property="schema:accessModeSufficient"&gt;textual&lt;/meta&gt;</pre>
            </div>

            <p>Without this metadata, users would not have known that they could read the publication only via its text
               content.</p>

            <p>The full set of entries in this example is as follows:</p>

            <div class="example">
               <pre>&lt;meta property="schema:accessMode"&gt;textual&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="schema:accessMode"&gt;visual&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="schema:accessModeSufficient"&gt;textual,visual&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="schema:accessModeSufficient"&gt;textual&lt;/meta&gt;
</pre>
            </div>

            <p>Note that sufficiency of access is often a subjective determination of the Author based on their understanding
               of what information is essential to comprehending the text. Some information loss occurs by not being able to
               view a video, for example, but the Author might regard the visual or auditory losses as inconsequential if a
               transcript provides all the necessary information to understand the concepts being conveyed.</p>

            <p>Refer to the <a href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"
               ><code>accessModeSufficient</code></a> definition in [[schema.org]] for more information about this property
               and its values.</p>

            <div class="note">
               <p>The <code>accessModeSufficient</code> property, as defined in [[schema.org]], allows more complicated
                  expressions than can be represented in the EPUB 2 or 3 Package Document (e.g., defininition of lists of
                  values and inclusion of a human-readable description). A future version of EPUB might allow for richer
                  metadata, but the basic expression shown in this section is sufficient for discovery purposes.</p>
            </div>

         </section>

         <section class="suppress-numbering" id="meta-003">
            <h2>META-003: Identify accessibility features</h2>

            <p>Identifying all the accessibility features and adaptations included in an <a>EPUB Publication</a> allows users
               to determine whether the content is usable at a more fine-grained level than the access modes do.</p>

            <p>For example, a math textbook might have a textual access mode, but that in itself does not indicate whether
               MathML markup is available. Whether a visual work only provides alternative text or whether it includes
               extended descriptions is also important to know when gauging its usability.</p>

            <p>Accessibility features are identified in the [[schema.org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"
                     ><code>accessibilityFeature</code> property</a>. Repeat this property for each feature.</p>

            <aside class="example">
               <p>The following example shows the metadata entries for an EPUB 3 Publication that has both MathML and
                  alternative text.</p>
               <pre>&lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature"&gt;MathML&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature"&gt;alternativeText&lt;/meta&gt;</pre>
            </aside>

            <p>The EPUB format requires that some accessibility features will always be present (e.g., a table of contents).
               Do not exclude these features from the accessibility metadata, as users typically are not aware what features
               are built into a format. Failing to include entries will reduce the discoverability of the publication when
               users search for specific features.</p>

            <p>Refer to the <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"
               ><code>accessibilityFeature</code></a> definition in [[schema.org]] for more information about this property
               and its values.</p>

            <h2>META-004: Identify accessibility hazards</h2>

            <p>There are three widely-recognized hazards that can affect readers of digital content:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>flashing — if a resource flashes more than three times a second, it can cause seizures (e.g., videos and
                     animations). See also [[WCAG20]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#seizure">Guideline 2.3</a>.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>motion simulation — if a resource simulates motion, it can cause a user to become nauseated (e.g., a
                     video game drawn on the [[HTML]] <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element"
                        ><code>canvas</code> element</a>).</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>sound — certain sound patterns, such as ringing and buzzing, can cause seizures.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>

            <p><a>Authors</a> have to report whether or not their <a>EPUB Publications</a> contain resources that present any
               of these hazards to users, as they can have real physical effects.</p>

            <p>Hazards are identified in the [[schema.org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"
                     ><code>accessibilityHazard</code> property</a>. Repeat this property for each hazard.</p>

            <p>Unlike other accessibility properties, the presence of hazards can be expressed both positively and
               negatively. This design decision was made because users most often search for content that is free from
               hazards that affect them, but also want to know what dangers are present in any publications they
               discover.</p>

            <aside class="example">
               <p>The following example shows the metadata entries for an EPUB 3 Publication that has a flashing hazard but
                  no motion simulation or sound hazards.</p>
               <pre>&lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityHazard"&gt;flashing&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityHazard"&gt;noMotionSimulationHazard&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityHazard"&gt;noSoundHazard&lt;/meta&gt;</pre>
            </aside>

            <p>Do not skip reporting hazards just because an EPUB Publication does not contain any content that could present
               risks. Users cannot infer a meaning when no metadata is present. The value "<code>none</code>" can be used in
               such cases instead of repeating each non-hazard.</p>

            <p>If an EPUB Publication contains a hazard, provide additional information about its source and nature in the <a
                  href="#meta-005">accessibility summary</a>.</p>

            <p>If hazards cannot be definitively determined, report the value "<code>unknown</code>".</p>

            <p>Refer to the <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"><code>accessibilityHazard</code></a> definition
               in [[schema.org]] for more information about this property and its values.</p>

            <h2>META-005: Include an accessibility summary</h2>

            <p>An accessibility summary provides a brief, human-readable description of the accessibility characteristics of
               an <a>EPUB Publication</a>, or lack thereof.</p>

            <p>If an EPUB Publication does not meet the requirements for content accessibility in [[EPUBAccessibility]], the
               reason(s) it fails should be noted in the summary.</p>

            <p>An accessibility summary is provided using the [[schema.org]] <a
                  href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary"><code>accessibilitySummary</code> property</a>.</p>

            <aside class="example">

            <h2>META-006: Identify ARIA Conformance</h2>

            <p>Users of <a>Assistive Technologies</a> are able to interact with <a>EPUB Publications</a> through the
               accessibility APIs built into whichever platform they use (Windows, Mac, iOS, Linux, etc.). These APIs allow
               the Assistive Technology to communicate with the <a>Reading System</a> to read the text or control the
               interface, as needed.</p>

            <p><a>Authors</a> of static content do not have to worry about this interaction, as the user's Reading System
               exposes the necessary information to the accessibility APIs (provided it has been developed to be accessible).
               Authors who create EPUB Publications that contain dynamic content — such as scripting and custom controls — do
               need to pay attention to the compatibility of such content, as Assistive Technologies may not receive
               sufficient information to provide an accessible interface.</p>

            <p>In the case of scripted content, the static picture of the content that an Assistive Technology initially
               generates will not get updated unless the Author follows the accessibility practices in [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]].
               Similarly, although Assistive Technologies have access to information about native [[HTML]] form elements
               (e.g., buttons and inputs), Authors often create custom elements whose state is opaque without correct use of
               [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] roles, state and properties  (e.g., checkboxes made out of images). Users want to know that
               such content has been made compatible with Reading System that support ARIA.</p>

            <p>ARIA compatibility is identified in the [[schema.org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityAPI"
                     ><code>accessibilityAPI</code> property</a>.</p>

            <aside class="example">

            <h2>META-007: Identify Input Control Methods</h2>

            <p>Not everyone who reads an <a>EPUB Publication</a> uses the same input control methods. Not only will the
               device affect the input method (e.g., mobile or desktop), but so will the user's physical abilities. Users
               might use any number of input methods, from touch to mice to keyboards to voice controls and on.</p>

            <p>As a result, all users need to know what input controls work with the content, as it will affect not only
               whether they can operate the content but on what devices.</p>

            <p>Similar to the <a href="#meta-006">accessibility APIs</a>, the input control methods that can be used to read
               an EPUB Publication are greatly influenced by the accessibility of the <a>Reading System</a>. It is only when
                  <a>Authors</a> include dynamic content that they assume a responsibility for ensuring that such is

         <section id="sec-wcag-general">
            <h2>General Guidance</h2>

            <p>Techniques for meeting the requirements of the [[WCAG20]] are defined in [[WCAG20-TECHS]]. This document does
               not repeat these techniques.</p>

            <p>In general, the differences between the application of WCAG techniques to Web pages and their application to
                  <a>EPUB Content Documents</a> is minimal, but the following sections outline some key differences.</p>

            <p>One point to note is that the WCAG techniques cover a greater range of technologies and content types than are
               typically found in an <a>EPUB Publication</a>, so many are not applicable.</p>

            <p>The following sets of techniques are the most broadly applicable to EPUB Content Documents:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>

               </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Other techniques will apply depending on the technologies used (e.g., a [[SWF]] video in EPUB 2) or any
               alternative formats embedded in the EPUB Publication (e.g., a PDF form).</p>

                     Publication</a> typically spans multiple documents. It is consequently essential not only that each
                     <a>EPUB Content Document</a> has a meaningful order, but that the order is meaningful from document to

               </aside>

               <p>Authors also need to ensure that they identify whether items in the spine contain primary or supplementary

                     2.4.5</a> requires there be more than one way to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages. By

               <p>The reason an EPUB Publication passes by meeting these requirements has to do with differences in how a

                  Publication typically consists of many <a data-lt="EPUB Content Documents">Content Documents</a>,
                     <a>Reading Systems</a> automatically provide the ability for the user to move seamlessly from one
                  document to the next, so long as they are listed in the <a
                     href="http://www.idpf.org/epub3/latest/packages#sec-spine-elem">spine</a> [[Packages]]. To the user, an
                  EPUB Publication is a single document they have complete access to, not a set of disconnected pages that
                  they need links to move through.</p>

               <p>The required table of contents provides a second method to access the major headings of the publication.
                  The user can jump to any heading and continue to navigate from there, regardless of how the publication is
                  chunked.</p>

               <p>Following these two requirements therefore satisfies the need for multiple ways to access the content.
                  Reading Systems also typically provide search capabilities, something the Author cannot provide, so users
                  also have a third option available in most cases.</p>

               <p>Although Authors only need to follow EPUB requirements to meet this criteria, they are still encouraged to
                  provide additional methods to improve access beyond the minimum. Some suggestions include:</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>adding at least one link to every Content Document in the spine to the table of contents, when
                        feasible;</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>adding an index to locate major topics;</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>adding additional navigation aids to the <a>EPUB Navigation Document</a> (e.g., lists of figures and
                        tables).</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>

                  <h4>Note About the Table of Contents</h4>

                  <p>A common question about the EPUB table of contents is what completeness it needs to have with respect to
                     the headings of the publication. Although the obvious answer seems like it should be a simple
                     aggregation of all headings for all sections, practically there are a number of usability challenges to
                     this approach.</p>

                  <p>Factors such as device screen sizes can make the table of contents for publications with a deep
                     hierarchy of headings unreadable, so <a>Authors</a> will trim headings below a certain depth to improve
                     the readability. Further, <a>Reading Systems</a> do not always provide structured access to the headings
                     in the table of contents, or provide shortcuts to navigate the links. The result is that users have to
                     listen to each link one at a time to find where they want to go, a tedious and time-consuming
                     process.</p>

                  <p>Although it is expected that Reading Systems will improve access to the table of contents as
                     accessibility support for EPUB evolves — making complete tables of contents usable by everyone — there
                     are legitimate usability reasons why they are not provided now.</p>

                  <p>When Authors choose not to provide links to all the headings, however, they should optimize the linking
                     they do provide for the best overall reading experience. Some considerations on how to achieve this
                     include:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <p>ensuring that there is at least one link to every <a>EPUB Content Document</a> — allowing the user
                           to reach each document simplifies navigation to the minor headings within them;</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>only omitting minor headings from the table of contents — although a subjective decision, there is
                           often a level of diminishing value for navigation (e.g., fourth level and lower headings often
                           only delimit short subsections on a topic).</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>

               <h3>SEM-001: Include ARIA and EPUB semantics</h3>

               <p>The [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#roles"><code>role</code> attribute</a> is
                  used to provide additional semantic information about the host markup to <a>Assistive Technologies</a>. The
                  use of roles allows Assistive Technologies to automatically scan the markup and compile a list of <a
                     href="#sem-003">landmarks</a> for users, enabling quick access to key features of the content.
                     <a>Authors</a> can attach this attribute to any element.</p>

               <aside class="example">
                  <p>The following example shows a generic landmark role. The name to use for this landmark is specified by
                     the [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby"
                           ><code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute</a>.</p>
                  <pre>&lt;section role="region" aria-labelledby="puz01"&gt;
   &lt;h2 id="puz01"&gt;Puzzles and Games&lt;h2&gt;
   …
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>
               </aside>

               <p>The <code>role</code> attribute is similar in nature to the <a
                     href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-epub-type-attribute"
                     ><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[ContentDocs]], which provides additional semantic information to
                  enable EPUB Reading System behaviors.</p>

               <aside class="example">
                  <p>The following example shows the <code>epub:type</code> attribute used to provide additional semantic
                     information.</p>
                  <pre>&lt;section epub:type="learning-objectives"&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;h2&gt;
   …
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>
               </aside>

               <p>The key difference between these attributes is that the <code>role</code> attribute bridges accessibility
                  while the <code>type</code> attribute provides hooks to enable Reading System behaviors. Omitting roles
                  lessens the accessibility for users of Assistive Technologies, in other words, while omitting types
                  diminishes certain functionality in <a>Reading Systems</a> (e.g., pop-up footnotes or special presentations
                  of the content).</p>

               <p>Since each attribute offers different advantages, it is recommended that both be used whenever applicable
                  to provide the best reading experience for all readers.</p>

               <p>It is often the case that the attributes will have have corresponding semantics. In these situations, it is
                  recommended that both attributes be attached to an element.</p>

               <aside class="example">
                  <p>The following example shows a footnote identified in both the <code>epub:type</code> and
                        <code>role</code> attributes.</p>
                  <pre>&lt;aside epub:type="footnote" role="doc-footnote"&gt;

               <h3>SEM-002: Do not repeat semantics across chunked content</h3>

               <p>Although <a>EPUB Publications</a> appear as single contiguous documents to users when read, they are
                  typically composed of many individual <a>EPUB Content Documents</a>. This practice keeps the amount of
                  markup that has to be rendered small to reduce the load time in <a>Reading Systems</a> (i.e., to minimize
                  the time the user has to wait for a document to appear). It is rare, at least for books, for an EPUB
                  Publication to contain only one Content Document with all the content in it.</p>

               <p>When content is chunked in this way, it often requires the Author to make decisions about how best to
                  restructure the information. A part, for example, will typically not include all the chapters that belong
                  to it. The Author will instead separate the part heading from each chapter, putting each into a separate
                  document.</p>

               <p>Although visually these restructuring decisions can be hidden from readers, they impact the functionality
                  of <a>Assistive Technologies</a>. In the case of [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] roles, the result is that only the subset
                  present in the currently-loaded EPUB Content Document are exposed to users. An Assistive Technology cannot
                  provide a list of landmarks for the whole publication, as it cannot see outside the current document.</p>

               <p>To counteract this destructuring effect, <a>Authors</a> sometimes think to re-add or re-identify structures
                  in the belief that having this information in every document will be helpful to users (e.g., adding an
                  extra [[HTML]] <code>section</code> element around a chapter to indicate it belongs to a part, or putting
                  the part semantic on the <code>body</code> tag). All this practice does, however, is add repetition that is
                  not only disruptive when reading, but can actually make the structure of the publication harder to follow.
                  Authors are therefore advised not to attempt to rebuild structures in these ways.</p>

               <p>For example, consider a book that has five parts and each part contains five chapters. Structurally, each
                  chapter belongs to its part (i.e., is grouped with it), as in the following markup:</p>

               <div class="example">
                  <pre>&lt;section role="doc-part"&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Part 1&lt;/h1&gt;
   
   &lt;section role="doc-chapter"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;
      …
   &lt;/section&gt;
   …
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>
               </div>

               <p>Since this would lead to a large content file, the part heading is typically split out into its own Content
                  Document so that it will appear on its own page:</p>

               <div class="example">
                  <pre>&lt;html … &gt;
   …
   &lt;body role="doc-part"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Part 1&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
               </div>

               <p>Each chapter is then separated into a separate Content Document:</p>

               <div class="example">
                  <pre>&lt;html … &gt;
   …
   &lt;body role="doc-chapter"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
               </div>

               <p>It is not necessary to add a part wrapper to each chapter, as in the following example:</p>

               <div class="example">
                  <pre>&lt;html … &gt;
   …
   &lt;body role="doc-part"&gt;
      &lt;section role="doc-chapter"&gt;
         &lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;
         …
      &lt;/section&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
               </div>

               <p>Doing so introduces a new <code>part</code> landmark into each document, which will cause an Assistive
                  Technology to inform the user that the landmark is available to navigate to.</p>

            <section class="suppress-numbering" id="sem-003">
               <h3>SEM-003: Include EPUB landmarks</h3>

               <p>[[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dfn-landmark">landmarks</a> are similar in
                  nature to <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub3/latest/packages#sec-nav-landmarks">EPUB
                  landmarks</a> [[Packages]]: both are designed to provide users with quick access to the major structures of
                  a document, such as chapters, glossaries and indexes. ARIA landmarks are compiled automatically by
                     <a>Assistive Technologies</a> from the <a href="#sem-001">roles</a> that have been applied to the
                  markup, so <a>Authors</a> only need to follow the requirement to include roles for the landmarks to be made
                  available to users.</p>

               <p>Although automatic generation of ARIA landmarks simplifies authoring, it also means that ARIA landmarks are
                  limited to how the <a>EPUB Publication</a> has been chunked up into <a data-lt="EPUB Content Documents"
                     >Content Documents</a>. An Assistive Technology can only present the landmarks available in the
                  currently-loaded document; it cannot provide a complete picture of all the landmarks in a multi-document
                  publication (see the <a href="#sem-002">previous section</a> for more discussion about content
                  chunking).</p>

               <p>EPUB landmarks, on the other hand, are compiled by the Author prior to distribution, and are not directly
                  linked to the use of the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub3/latest/contentdocs#sec-epub-type-attribute"
                        ><code>type</code> attribute</a> [[ContentDocs]] in the content. They are designed to simplify
                  linking to major sections of the publication in a machine-readable way, as <a>Reading Systems</a> do not
                  scan the entire publication for landmarks, either. EPUB landmarks are typically not as numerous as ARIA
                  landmarks, as Reading Systems only expose so many of these navigation aids.</p>

               <p>Given these differences in application, however, it is important to include EPUB landmarks and not rely
                  only on the presence of ARIA roles to facilitate navigation, and vice versa. Each aids navigation in its
                  own way.</p>

               <p>The EPUB specification does not require that Authors include a specific set of landmarks, but it is
                  recommended to include a link to the start of the body matter as well as to any major reference sections
                  (e.g., table of contents, endnotes, bibliography, glossary, index).</p>

               <h3>TITLES-002: Ensure numbered headings reflect publication hierarchy</h3>

               <p>To a user, an <a>EPUB Publication</a> appears as a single document that they read from beginning to end,
                  even though the content is often split across numerous <a>EPUB Content Documents</a>. As a result, their
                  natural expectation is that the headings reflect their position in the overall hierarchy of the
                  publication, despite the publication not actually being a single document (e.g., if a part heading is
                  expressed in an [[HTML]] <code>h1</code> element, each chapter that belongs to the part will have
                     an <code>h2</code> heading).</p>

               <p>[[WCAG20-TECHS]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G141.html">G141: Organizing a page using
                     headings</a> instructs <a>Authors</a> on correctly using numbered headings within a document, but with
                  EPUB Publications the numbered headings also need to remain consistent across documents. Practically, this
                  means that each EPUB Content Document does not have to begin with an <code>h1</code> heading unless the
                  first heading is a top-level heading — the first heading needs to have a numbered heading element that
                  reflects its actual position in the publication.</p>

               <p>Authors also to need chunk their content so that the first heading in a document always has the highest
                  number. For example, if a document starts with an <code>h3</code> heading, there shouldn't be
                     an <code>h2</code> heading later in the document (e.g., do not include the start of a new section with
                  the trailing subsections of the previous). It is acceptable for there to be subsequent headings at the same
                  level as the first (e.g., multiple subsections in one document could all have <code>h3</code>
                  headings).</p>

               <h3>DESC-001: Include alternative text descriptions</h3>

               <p>[[WCAG20]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#text-equiv-all">Success Criterion 1.1.1</a> requires a
                  text alternative for all non-text content. In the case of image content, the provision of alternative text
                  (e.g., in an [[HTML]] <code>alt</code> attribute) is sufficient for meeting the requirements of the
                  [[EPUBAccessibility]] specification.</p>

               <p><a>Authors</a> are strongly encouraged to include extended descriptions, but the utility of extended
                  descriptions often depends on the needs of the user. Until the publishing ecosystem matures, making it
                  easier for Authors to include extended descriptions and write them to optimally meet the needs of the
                  greatest number of users, they are not required.</p>

               <p>If extended descriptions are not included, note the omission in the <a href="#meta-005">accessibility
                     summary</a>.</p>

               <div class="note">
                  <p>The requirement for a text alternative does not apply to decorative images that contribute no
                     information to the text. These are identified by an empty <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="caution">

                  <p>This guidance applies to the evaluation of <a>EPUB Publications</a> strictly for achieving conformance

                     where extended descriptions are required, this guidance for conformance will not be sufficient.</p>

                  <p>The use of alternative text as a sufficient description for all images may be removed in a future

               <h3>TEXT-001 - Use Unicode for text content</h3>

               <p>[[WCAG20]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#text-equiv-all">Success Criterion 1.1.1</a> requires that
                  text equivalents be provided for all non-text content to meet Level A. In some regions (e.g., Asia), it is
                  not uncommon to find images of individual text characters, despite the availability of Unicode character
                  equivalents. This practice occurs for various reasons, such as ease of translation of older documents and
                  for compatibility across <a>Reading Systems</a>.The use of images in most instances leads to the text not
                  being accessible to non-visual users, however.</p>

               <p>When individual characters are replaced by images, there is invariably a negative effect on text-to-speech
                  playback, even when alternative text is provided (e.g., if single characters within a word are replaced by
                  images, the word will not be read as a single unit of text). It is also problematic for visual users, as
                  the images often scale poorly and the characters cannot be changed to different font families to meet user
                  preferences.</p>

               <p>The use of Unicode characters for all text content avoids this problem, allowing content to successfully
                  meet the minimum requirement for Level A.</p>

               <p>For compliance with Level AA, Authors are directed to <a
                     href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation">Success Criterion 1.4.5</a>

            <h2>Accessible Alternatives</h2>

            <p>As <a>EPUB Publications</a> can be composed of more than one <a>Rendition</a>, it is possible that different
               versions of the content will have different levels of accessibility. For example, an image-based version of
               the content that lacks alternative text or descriptions could be bundled with a WCAG-compliant text-based
               serialization. This type of accessible bundling is acceptable, as [[WCAG20]] allows non-conforming content
               provided a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conforming-alternate-versiondef">conforming alternate
                  version</a> is available.</p>

            <p>The [[MultipleRenditions]] specification defines a set of features for creating these types of EPUB
               Publications. In particular, it specifies a set of attributes that allow a <a>Reading System</a> to
               automatically select a preferred Rendition for the user, or to provide the user the option to manually select
               between the available options. This functionality technically meets the requirements of [[WCAG20]] in terms of
               ensuring the user can access the accessible version.</p>

            <p>In practice, however, the [[MultipleRenditions]] specification is not broadly supported in Reading Systems at
               the time of publication. As a result, a user who obtains an EPUB Publication that contains more than one
               Rendition will only have access to the <a>Default Rendition</a>. Unless this Rendition is the accessible one,
               the EPUB Publication might not be readable by them.</p>

            <p><a>Authors</a> therefore need to use their best discretion when implementing this functionality to meet
               accessibility requirements. EPUB Publications that contain multiple renditions are conformant to the
               [[EPUBAccessibility]] specification if at least one Rendition meets all the content requirements, but Authors
               at a minimum need to note that a Reading System that supports multiple renditions is required in their <a
                  href="#meta-005">accessibility summary</a>. Any other methods the Author can use to make this dependence
               known is advisable (e.g., in the <a href="#dist-002">distribution metadata</a>).</p>

            <p>This section will be updated with techniques for using multiple renditions when there is enough support in
               Reading Systems to broadly recommend their use.</p>

               <p>Both the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary [[EPUB-SSV]] and Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA 1.0 Module
                  [[DPUB-ARIA-1.0]] include a semantic for static page breaks: <a
                     href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/#pagebreak">pagebreak</a> and <a
                     href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/#doc-pagebreak">doc-pagebreak</a>, respectively.</p>

               <p>It is recommended that both semantics be applied to EPUB 3 content to ensure maximum compatibility with
                     <a>Reading Systems</a> and <a>Assistive Technologies</a>.</p>

               <aside class="example">
                  <p>The following example shows an HTML5 <code>span</code> element identified as a pagebreak.</p>

               </aside>

               <p>A <code>title</code> or <code>aria-label</code> attribute is required on the element, as it provides the
                  value that is announced to the user. Do not include the page number as text content, as this practice
                  forces the user to hear it announced wherever it occurs (e.g., without any context in the middle of a
                  sentence).</p>

               <p>EPUB 2 does not include markup to identify static page break marks in the content. Page break destinations
                  can be included to enable hyperlinking, but the <a href="#page-003">page list</a> is the only way a user
                  can jump to the locations.</p>

               <aside class="example">
                  <p>The following example shows an XHTML 1.1 <code>span</code> element used as a hyperlink destination.</p>

                  element was previously defined as the anchor for a hyperlink destination, its purpose has been changed in
                  [[HTML]] for use solely as a link.</p>

               <h3>PAGE-002: Identify pages in audio playback</h3>

               <p>Readers rarely stop reading to review each new page number, so when page numbers are read aloud in the
                  audio playback of a publication it is not only distracting, but can be confusing, as well (e.g., the number
                  could be read out in the middle of a sentence).</p>

               <p>To mitigate this potential annoyance to readers, Authors need to identify page announcements in the EPUB 3
                  media overlays document when they are included. Identification allows a Reading System to provide a
                  playback experience where the numbers are automatically skipped.</p>

               <p>To identify page numbers in EPUB 3 Publications, attach an <code>epub:type</code> attribute with the value
                     "<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/#pagebreak"><code>pagebreak</code></a>" [[EPUB-SSV]]

               <h3>PAGE-003: Provide a page list</h3>

               <p>A page list — a list of hyperlinks to the static page break locations — is the most effective way for users
                  to find static page locations. Without a page list, the user would have to navigate each page marker in the
                  text, provided they are available and the <a>Reading System</a> provides such functionality.</p>

               <p>When a page list is included, <a>Reading Systems</a> can provide users direct access to the list or use it
                  to provide automatic page jump functionality.</p>

               <p>The <a>EPUB Navigation Document</a> allows the inclusion of a <a
                     href="http://www.idpf.org/epub3/latest/packages#sec-nav-pagelist"><code>page-list
                  nav</code></a> [[Packages]], while the EPUB 2 NCX file provides the same functionality through the <a
                     href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm#Section2.4.1.2"

               <h3>PAGE-004: Identify the pagination source</h3>

               <p>Users typically want to know the source of the page break markers included in an <a>EPUB Publication</a>
                  when they are derived from a static media. Considerations like which printing, by which publisher or
                  imprint, and whether the pagination comes from the hard or soft cover edition will affect decisions about
                  its usefulness (e.g., does it exactly match the pagination of a print book used in a classroom).</p>

               <p>To allow users to determine the suitability of the pagination, identify the ISBN of the source work in the
                  Package Document metadata.</p>

               <aside class="example">
                  <p>The following example shows a <code>dc:source</code> element containing the ISBN of the print source of

         <section class="suppress-numbering" id="dist-001">
            <h2>DIST-001: Do not restrict access through digital rights management</h2>

            <p><a>EPUB Publications</a> typically require preservation of the publisher's and author's intellectual property
               when distributed (e.g., so that they can be made available for individual sale through online bookstores or
               distributed through library systems). The most common way to address this need has been through the
               application of digital rights management (DRM) schemes to the packaged EPUB Publication. DRM enables a variety
               of security features that aren't native to the EPUB format, such as the ability to limit access to a single
               user and to limit the length of time the person can access the publication (e.g., library loans).</p>

            <p>In general, DRM can be made to work interoperably with <a>Assistive Technologies</a>, but problems arise when
               DRM restrictions remove direct access to an EPUB Publication or restrict access to the content within it.
               Unless the Reading System implementing the DRM provides API level access to the content, it can prove
               difficult, or even impossible, to generate text-to-speech playback, or for a refreshable braille display to
               have access to the underlying text, as well as cause other accessibility issues.</p>

            <p>The application of digital rights management therefore must not impair or impede the functionality of
               Assistive Technologies on EPUB Publications users have the right to access.</p>

            <h2>DIST-002: Include accessibility metadata in distribution records</h2>

            <p>When an <a>EPUB Publication</a> is ingested into a distribution system, such as a bookstore or library, a
               metadata record is often provided separately to the distributor. In these scenarios, the metadata used to
               enable discovery of the publication typically comes from the distribution record alone, not from the metadata
               in the Package Document.</p>

            <p>The result is that it is necessary to include as much accessibility metadata in distribution records as their
               vocabularies allow.</p>

            <div class="note">
               <p>The use of distribution records does not remove the requirement to include accessibility metadata in the
                  Package Document. The metadata in the Package Document ensures accessibility information is always
                  available with the publication.</p>

            <aside class="example">
               <p>The following example shows an ONIX record with accessibility metadata that states that the EPUB
                  Publication has no accessibility features disabled (10), a table of contents (11) and a correct reading
                  order (13).</p>
