### [Best Practice 1: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for Spatial Things](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#globally-unique-ids)

#### Conformance statement

Check that within the data [Spatial Things](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#dfn-spatial-thing), such as countries, regions and people, are referred to by HTTP URIs or by short identifiers that can be converted to HTTP URIs. Ideally dereferencing the URIs should return the [Spatial Thing](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#dfn-spatial-thing), however, they have value as globally scoped variables whether they dereference or not | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul>
