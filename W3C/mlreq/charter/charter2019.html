<h1 id="title">DRAFT Mongolian  Layout Task Force Charter</h1>
<p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of this task force  is to discuss and document gaps, document requirements, and offer advice for the layout and presentation of text in   languages written in the Traditional Mongolian script  when those languages  are used by Web standards and technologies, such as HTML,  CSS, Mobile Web, Digital Publications and Unicode.</p>
<p class="mission"> The Traditional Mongolian script is used by various communities in
  north and east Asia, speaking different languages,
  and participation in this work by those communities is welcomed.
  This task force will gather and integrate feedback from the
  participating members about the need for and technical
feasibility of various requirements.</p>
<p class="mission">The Task Force is part of the W3C Internationalization Interest Group.  The Task Force will report the results of its activities as a group back to the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/i18n-wg/">W3C Internationalization Working Group</a>, as well as to other relevant groups and to the W3C membership and community.</p>
<p class="mission">This charter is intended to reflect the current direction of the group, so that there is common agreement. It may be altered at any point in order to reflect new priorities or work items.</p>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>This work aims to ensure that the W3C is developing a Web for All, with a particular emphasis on  Traditional Mongolian script.</p>
<p>The group exists to allow a network of experts to share information about gaps and requirements for support of Traditional Mongolian script on the Web and in digital publications. </p>
<p>Topics for discussion are suggested by <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/gap-analysis/" rel="nofollow">the gap-analysis document</a>. This work supports the development of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" rel="nofollow">matrix</a> indicating hot-spots for language support. The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc.   We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces.</p>
<p>A significant problem faced by the Web is that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script or language, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise. This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem. They will be asked to consider and advise on issues that arise during the development of technologies at W3C. See the i18n WG's <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=mongolian">Layout tracker page</a> for examples of such issues.</p>
<p>Experts who are <em>contributing</em> members of the task force will go a step further, and contribute to  documents produced by the group, as described in the section on deliverables below.</p>
<p>The information produced in documents or discussed via GitHub issues needs to be relayed to the appropriate groups at W3C (and perhaps in other groups), and task force participants will probably want to be involved in those discussions. The notification framework already in place helps participants track issues raised against W3C working groups.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the group may do the following: 
  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer questions for the Internationalization WG and other W3C WGs related to the implementation of Mongolian support in specifications and implementations.</li>
  <li>Review W3C specifications, especially CSS, to ensure that Traditional Mongolian is adequately supported.    </li>
<li>Create tests to support documentation of gaps and to help check implementations.</li>
<li>Translate W3C resources into Mongolian.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Initial set of languages</h3>
<p>Several languages use the Traditional Mongolian script. The initial focus of this task force will be on the script as used for Mongolian in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia.
  Information regarding other languages will be included based
on the availability of linguistic and typographic experts.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>The Mongolian Text Layout Task Force will not produce Recommendation-track deliverables but will produce documents that can be published by the Internationalization Working Group as Working Group Notes. Such work is expected to include the following. The completion of the work depends upon resource availability.</p>
<p>The  main deliverables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/gap-analysis/" rel="nofollow"> gap-analysis document</a>, which is one of many similar documents that radiate out from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" rel="nofollow">language matrix</a> to help us track areas where better support is needed. The gap analysis document uses a standard structure to list issues that content users and content authors face relating to particular apects of text layout, provide pointers to tests, and prioritise the importance of the barriers documented. Work on the gap-analysis document may procede in phases, starting with a quick preliminary report.</li>
<li>A document describing requirements for  Mongolian text layout and presentation on the Web.</li>
<li>Other documents advising standards developers and application developers on how to cater for Mongolian needs. Some of those documents may be developed elsewhere and brought to this group for review and subsequent publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the deliverables must conform to standard formats developed across the W3C language enablement work, so that the work can be integrated into the larger picture. The wider W3C framework into which this work fits is described in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-discuss/wiki/Analysing-support-for-text-layout-on-the-Web">Analysing support for text layout on the Web</a>.</p>
<p>Technology-specific information about Mongolian support should be included in the gap analysis resources, not in the layout requirements document. The latter should just describe how Mongolian is expected to work, in a technology agnostic way, so that it is enduringly relevant.</p>
<p>The group may also choose to produce other non-normative deliverables, such as test cases and error reports â€“ under the terms of the Policies for Contribution of Test Cases to W3C, and in coordination with any relevant working groups.</p>
<p>Documents may be produced in Mongolian or Chinese, but must be translated into English. The English version will be the authoritative version at the W3C, since people who don't speak Mongolian are an important part of the target audience for the documents.  In fact, making available information to an international audience is an important aspect of the group's mission. English snapshots of the document must be produced at regular intervals, so that the international community is able to review and comment on the work in progress.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="dependencies">
<h2 id="coordination">Relationships to External Groups</h2>

<p>Working Drafts and Notes will be published by the i18n WG, and the i18n WG will work with the task force closely to assist with development and review of the documents. For information about the wider framework into which the Mongolian layout work fits, see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-discuss/wiki/Analysing-support-for-text-layout-on-the-Web">Analysing support for text layout on the Web</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>The Task Force provides for two levels of participation.</p>
<p><strong>Followers</strong> are subscribed to the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-mongolian/" rel="nofollow">public-i18n-mongolian</a> mailing list, where they can track discussions, and contribute opinions via the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mlreq/issues">GitHub issue list</a>. Rather than just 'Watch' the GitHub repository, it is best to subscribe to the  mailing list, because that list is notified once a day (in digest form) about activity in the mlreq repository, but also about  activity for other W3C Working Group issues related to Japanese. (Participants are expected to use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)</p>
<p><strong>Task force members</strong> are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in any meetings. These people are subscribed to the task force group by W3C staff.</p>
<p>All TF members and people making contributions (via issues or pull requests) must read and agree with <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mlreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>.</p>
<p>Participants are reminded of the <a
href="/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">Good
Standing requirements</a> of the W3C Process.</p>
<p>People contributing substantive text to the deliverables must be public invited experts or work for W3C member organizations, in order to meet the policy requirements of section 7 of this charter.</p>
</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mlreq">mlreq GitHub repository</a> and its issue list are the main vehicles for technical discussion. Discussion can be in Chinese, Mongolian and English but, where useful,  discussions should be summarised in English when a conclusion is reached, so that the wider community can follow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-mongolian/">public-i18n-mongolian@w3.org</a> list receives notifications of changes in the mlreq repository, and also of changes to issues in other repositories when those issues are tagged with a mlreq label. This includes the CSS and HTML repositories, amongst others. That mailing list should not be used for technical discussion.</p>
<p>The public-i18n-mongolian@w3.org list must archive or point to
  minutes and summaries of all teleconferences and face-to-face
  meetings. Meeting minutes will list all attendees at a given
meeting.</p>
<p>An administrative list, <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-mlreq-admin/">public-mlreq-admin</a>, will also be
  used for internal communication about practical matters, such
  as meeting agenda, which should be published before each
teleconference or face-to-face meeting.</p>

<p>The group will use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/"> Internationalization Activity home page </a> and <a
href="https://www.chinaw3c.org/"> W3C China Website </a>to provide updated public information about its activities.
</p>
<p> Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mlreq">mlreq GitHub repository</a>. </p>
<p>Meetings may  be held in Mongolian or Chinese, but an effort should be made to communicate key findings and conclusions in English in the minutes.</p>
</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p>As explained in the Process Document (<a
href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>),
this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. In cases where there is a need to formally produce a group resolution about a particular issue, its Chair will put a question about the issue to the group and gather responses (including any formal objections); then, after due consideration of all the responses, the Chair will record a group resolution (possibly after a formal vote and also along with responding to any formal objections).</p>
</div>

<div class="patent">
<h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Policy </h2>

<p>Participants in the Mongolian Text Layout Task Force are obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy as outlined out inÂ <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section 6</a>Â of the W3C Patent Policy document. Although the Mongolian Text Layout Task Force is not chartered to produce Recommendation-track documents that themselves require patent disclosure, participants in the group are nevertheless obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy for any Recommendation-track specifications that they review or comment on.</p>
        <p>For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see
the <a href="/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy
Implementation</a>.</p>
