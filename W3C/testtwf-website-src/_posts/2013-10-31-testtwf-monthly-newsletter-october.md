On this All Hallow's Eve, we're wearing our dinosaur costumes in 
celebration of this day and of another great month-- and we'll be keeping them on until we get to China.  October brought in many new members to to our community, hundreds of registrants for our next big event, a dazzling lineup of confirmed speakers (including Tim Berners-Lee!), and we officially became part of the W3C!


### Welcome New Subscribers ###

 Welcome to the many new subscribers we met at HTML5 DevConf in 
 San Francisco!  We really enjoyed talking to so many passionate
 web developers and telling you all about Test the Web Forward
 and [WebPlatform.org][1]. Although not surprising, we were happy to 
 see that the goals of both of these initiatives resonated deeply 
 with you.

### Upcoming TestTWF Events ###

#### Test the Web Forward @TPAC, Shenzhen, China: 11/9, 9AM-7PM CST

 We're less than two weeks away and registration for TestTWF Shenzhen
 is now full! We're proud to have the W3C Beihang Site Manager, Angel
 Li as our keynote speaker and very excited to have Tim Berners-Lee 
 add some parting words to wrap up the event. Additionally, we have
 some excellent instructional talks lined up from Zhiaqiang Zhang and
 Belem Zhang, both from Intel and both TestTWF alumni and experienced
 W3C test writers.

 If you're not able to attend in person, you're still very much
 welcome to participate.  Log on to GitHub ([web-platform-tests][3],
 [css][2]) and jump into #testing on irc.w3.org and find out where you
 can start.  We'll happily take pull requests from all over the world.
 We'd especially like to see some past attendees from the Beijing,
 Shanghai, and Tokyo events!

### Test the Web Forward is Now Officially Part of the W3C ###

 Last month, we told you about the new and improved 
 [TestTheWebForward.org][6] website , which was part of transition.
 Now, we're pleased to announce that Test the Web Forward is now
 [officially part of the W3C][7]. This a great development that simply
 means that TestTWF now belongs to The Web, to the W3C members, and to
 you. While  we are actively working to build out this domain to
 include more than documentation, the events will continue be driven
 by the community. See below for how you can have one of your own.

### Get Involved ###

#### Contribute to TestTheWebForward.org

 With the relaunch of website, the W3C has provided a completely open
 repository on GitHub to host its content. We invite all of you
 to add your own, whether it be additional [documentation][8], a [blog
 post][9], something on the [TODO list][10], or just a bug fix -
 we'll take your [contribution][11].

#### Host your own Test the Web Forward event!
 
 As you start your planning for 2014, consider holding an event of
 your own - an intimate meetup focused on a topic suited to your 
 local community or user group, or partner with others to put on a
 hackathon to crank out more tests over some beer and pizza.
 Start the conversation at public-testtwf-planning@w3.org. We
 have kits to get you going and a growing network of TestTWF
 experts around the world.

Let's keep Making the Web a Better Place!
