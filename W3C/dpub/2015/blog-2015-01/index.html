      <h2>W3C’s Digital Publishing Interest Group</h2>
      <h3>Some History</h3>
      <p>Today, eBooks compete with printed versions, and there is a wide choice
        of hardware and software available for eBook readers. Journals and
        magazines are also made available digitally on the Web or in specialized
        applications and, in some cases, the printed version is even abandoned
        in favor of a purely digital version. The formats used by eBook readers
        and tablets for electronic books, magazines, journals and educational
        resources are largely based on the technologies developed at the <a href="http://www.w3.org">World
          Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C), such as (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL,
        MathML, or various Web API-s. Commercial publishers also rely on W3C
        technologies in their back-end processing all the way from authoring
        through to delivering the printed or electronic product and beyond. In
        general one can say that the Publishing Industry is one of the largest
        communities relying on a large palette of W3C technologies.</p>
      <p>Publishing has also high technical demands, for example in typesetting
        and graphics, high-level interactivity, and rich media. The experience
        in aesthetics and ergonomy that the Publishing Industry has accumulated
        over centuries should not be lost in this new era. However,
        groups at standards bodies, like the W3C, know little about the detailed
        requirements of publishers, as that industry did not contribute to the
        development of these foundational standards. The Publishing Industry has, mostly, been
        behaving in a fairly “passive” mode when it came to technology
        development. Technology oriented groups at W3C (or
        other standardization bodies) work with the requirements they know of
        and with the experts who join the groups; if the Digital Publishing
        Industry is not present around the table, the features it needs will not
        be considered. This leads to fragmentation, interoperability issues, and
        a disconnect between the Publishing Industry and, for example, the
        browser world.</p>
      <p>Recognizing this problem the W3C and <a href="http://www.idpf.org">IDPF</a>
        organized a series of Workshops in 2013 (in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/08/electronic-books/">New
          York</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/06/ebooks/">Tokyo</a>, and
        in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/12/global-publisher/">Paris</a>) to
        address this issue. This led to the establishment, in May 2013, of the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/dpub/">Digital Publishing Activity</a> and, in
        June 2013, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/Main_Page">Digital
          Publishing Interest Group</a> was formally chartered. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/02/digpubig.html">mission</a>
        of the Group states:</p>
      <blockquote>The mission of the Digital Publishing Interest Group (DPUB IG)
        […] a forum for experts in the digital publishing ecosystem […] for
        technical discussions, gathering use cases and requirements to align the
        existing formats and technologies (e.g., for electronic books) with
        those used by [W3C’s] Open Web Platform.</blockquote>
      <p>What does this mean in practice? The DPUB IG brings publishing experts
        together to identify issues that are not, or not adequately, addressed
        by the current generation of W3C technologies. These issues and
        requirements are documented and contacts are established with
        relevant Working Groups at the W3C who update or develop specifications
        based on these information. The Interest Group gathers experts from
        various companies and institutions, including professional publishers,
        like Wiley, Hachette, and Pearson, industry groups or non-profit
        institutions like the BISG, IDPF, or the Daisy Consortium, technology
        companies, like IBM, Google, Rakuten, Antenna House, or Apple, and
        academic institutions, like the University of Illinois or Ghent
        University. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Task Forces and Highlights</h3>
      <p>Obviously, the job of the DPUB IG is huge and complex; to manage those
        a set of Task Forces has been created. The choice of the task forces
        reflect the participants’ interest, and the approach they have taken in
        doing their work differ among task forces. The
        current task forces are as follows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Pagination
            and Layout Task Force</span> looks at the requirements publishers
          have on styling and pagination, beyond what the current Web
          technologies already provide,. These include hyphenation, drop caps,
          running headers and footers, or pagination control. The Task Force has
          published a document entitled “<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-latinreq/">Requirements
            for Latin Text Layout and Pagination”</a> (the document is still a
          draft and new releases are to be expected) and members of the Task
          Force are also active participants of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS">CSS
            Working Group</a> at W3C. The Task Force has contributed to
          the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-css-inline-3-20141218/">CSS
            Inline Layout Module Level 3</a>, a Working Draft that enables drop
          caps and stick-up caps in CSS. At the moment, one of the major focus
          of the group is to work, together with the CSS Working Group, on
          standardizing pagination information and control.</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Metadata
            Task Force</span> has <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-metadata/">published
            a Note</a> based on industry interviews with representatives of
          various sectors and roles within the publishing ecosystem. The
          fundamental question was whether the technologies offered by the W3C
          are appropriate to cover the Metadata needs of the Industry and what
          W3C can contribute in that particular area. The report establishes
          that the the main areas of possible action for the W3C are in outreach,
          technical discussions on how current technologies may and should be
          used, rather than the development of new specifications.</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Content
            and Markup Task Force</span> is working on an approach providing a
          standard way to add logical structures and information on top of (but
          staying compatible with) HTML. Examples are the identification of
          glossaries, footnotes, and (mathematical) proofs. The
          Task Force is working with W3C’s <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">Protocols
            and Formats Working Group</a>, which oversees extensions of HTML
          through standard attributes using a technology called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a>;
          these attributes, and the extensions thereof, may be used to describe
          the content of an HTML file. An interesting aspect of the work is that
          ARIA had been originally developed for Web Accessibility; by binding
          the structural markup to ARIA an improved accessibility in eBooks is
          also achieved.</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Accessibility
            Task Force</span>
          concentrates on accessibility guidelines. W3C has defined a number of
          Accessibility Guidelines (for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web
            Content Authors</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring
            Tools</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agents</a>)
          but, as emphasized in the introduction, these guidelines were
          typically developed without the participation of the Digital
          Publishing Industry. This Task Force should fill the gap by reviewing
          those guidelines and, possibly, suggest new features or alternative
          formulations. Steps may also be taken to advise and educate the Publishing
          Industry about more actively using these documents.</li>
        <li>The <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">STEM
            (Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine) Task Force</span>
          conducted initial interviews with industry experts and will send out a
          extensive survey by the end of the month to refine the information
          gathered in the interviews. STEM is a broad category, and the Task
          Force is looking to understand which areas are unique to STEM
          publishing. An example for a specific issue possibly arising is
          whether standard file formats for specific needs (e.g., for chemical
          formulae) should be standardized by W3C. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>One more Task Force is worth mentioning, although that Task Force is
        not active in this Interest Group any more. This is the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Annotation
          Task Force</span>. This Task Force collected and published an
        extensive <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-annotation-uc/">set of use
          cases and requirements</a> on Web annotations, a feature that is
        considered to be critical for, e.g., scholarly publishing. This work
        has now been spawned into a separate <a href="http://www.w3.org/annotation/">Annotation
          Working Group</a>, whose charter is to define a standard model for
        annotation exchange, access, and addressing. It is interesting to note
        that the Annotation Working Group is the first W3C Group that is based
        on the active cooperation of traditional Web Developers, Browser
        developers, and representatives of the Publishing Industry.</p>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>In addition to these activities, experts of W3C and of IDPF have also
        published a white paper entitled <a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/">"Advancing
          Portable Documents for the Open Web Platform: EPUB-WEB"</a>. This
        (unofficial) paper outlines a vision of portable documents as native
        citizens of the Web. Quoting from the white paper:</p>
      <blockquote>Our vision for EPUB-WEB is that portable documents become
        fully native citizens of the Open Web Platform. In this vision, the
        current format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable
        (EPUB) and online (Web) document publishing is diminished to zero. These
        are merely two dynamic manifestations of the same publication: content
        authored with online use as the primary mode can easily be saved by the
        user for offline reading in portable document form. Content authored
        primarily for use as a portable document can be put online, without any
        need for refactoring the content. Publishers can choose to utilize
        either or both of these publishing modes, and users can choose either or
        both of these consumption modes. Essential features flow seamlessly
        between online and offline modes; examples include cross-references,
        user annotations, access to online databases, as well as licensing and
        rights management.</blockquote>
      <p>EPUB-WEB may have a profound influence in a number of areas of
        publishing, including educational or scholarly publishing, electronic
        books, in-house documentation systems, and of course the way users
        manage documents on the Web. In the coming months, we will concentrate on
        whether and how this overall vision can be put in practice and whether
        this vision will result in working on a next generation of EPUB format
        that might reconcile the worlds of the Web and Publishing. At the
        moment, the focus is on gathering comments, identify further technical
        challenges as well issues touching on feasibility. If both the W3C and
        IDPF decide to go ahead, this may result in a major activity in around a
        year from now. (By the way, the authors welcome issues and comments from
        anyone, using the github <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epubweb/issues">issue
          system</a>). The role of the current Digital Publishing Interest Group
        may prove to be crucial in this process by participating in the
        discussion leading up to a possible specification work.</p>
