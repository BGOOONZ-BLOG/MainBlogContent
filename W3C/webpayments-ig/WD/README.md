# Web Payments IG Working Drafts

Time-stamped working drafts go in this directory. Do not create a file
in this directory until there is consensus to publish a time-stamped
IG Working Draft. You will know when that happens because the Chairs will
explicitly ask you to do so.

To create a time-stamped working draft:

1. Generate a static HTML file using ReSpec (CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-S).
2. Create a directory in this directory in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD
3. Place the static HTML file, naming it index.html, in the directory you
   created in the previous step.
