<h1 id="title">Arabic Text Layout Task Force Charter</h1>
<p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of this task force  is to  document requirements for the layout and presentation of text in languages using the Arabic script when those languages  are used by Web standards and technologies, such as HTML,  CSS, Mobile Web, Digital Publications and Unicode. </p>
<p class="mission"> The Arabic script is used by communities in various parts of the world, speaking very different languages, and participation in this work by those communities is welcomed. This task force will gather and integrate feedback from the participating members about the need  for and technical feasibility of various requirements.</p>
<p class="mission">The Task Force is part of the Internationalization Interest Group.</p>

<p class="mission">The aim of this Task Force is to follow the example of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> and collect information about specific use cases  for technologies defined in various Web specifications as they relate to the aforementioned scripts. The Task Force will report the results of its activities as a group back to the Internationalization  Working Group, as well as to other relevant groups and to the W3C membership and community.</p>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The main objective of the task force is to document typographic and layout requirements for languages using the Arabic script, for use with Web standards such as HTML,  CSS, and Digital Publication technologies.</p>
<p>Use of the Arabic and Perso-Arabic scripts extends beyond the Arabic and Persian languages. There are many languages that are currently or have historically been written in these scripts. These include many that are not linguistically related to Arabic or Persian, but which have adapted these scripts in various ways to accommodate their local linguistic needs. Although these languages and writing traditions are important, the initial focus of this Task Force will be on the usage associated with the Arabic and Persian languages.</p>
<p>In addition to those technologies mentioned above, the group may review (but is by no means explicitly limited to reviewing) the following: 
  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The work of the Internationalization Working Group.</li>
  <li>CSS3 Modules, in particular:
    <ul>
      <li>CSS3 Writing Modes Working Draft</li>
      <li>CSS3 Text</li>
      <li>CSS3 Lists</li>
      <li>CSS3 Transitions</li>
      <li>CSS3 Fonts</li>      
      <li>CSS3 Counter Styles</li>

    </ul></li>
<li>Browser testing and tools</li>
<li>HTML (in particular references to bidi, locale-specific formats, and other internationalization aspects)</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with reviewing the above mentioned specifications and related specifications, it is expected that the group will also gather comments and questions about those specifications, collect information about specific use cases affecting the Arabic script for technologies defined in those specifications, and report the results of its activities as a group back to the Internationalization Working Group, as well as to other relevant groups - such as the HTML Working Group, CSS Working Group, SVG Working Group, and other Working Groups at the W3C as needed.</p>

<h3>Initial set of languages</h3>

<p>Initial set of languages to be covered consists of Arabic and Persian. Information regarding other languages will be included based on the availability of linguistic and typographic experts.</p>
<p>The task force will not address typographic and layout requirements for Uighur, but will liaise with the sub-task force working on that language under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/groups/chinese-layout/">Chinese Layout Task Force</a>.
<div>
  <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>The Arabic Text Layout Task Force will not produce Recommendation-track deliverables but will produce documents that can be published by the Internationalization Working Group as Working Group Notes about text layout and typography in the Arabic script, the contents of which might include (but by no means are explicitly limited to) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements for  Text Layout and presentation.</li>
<li>Requirements for Digital Publications.</li>
<li>Translation of W3C drafts of related technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The group may also choose to produce other non-normative deliverables, such as test cases and error reports â€“ under the terms of the Policies for Contribution of Test Cases to W3C, and in coordination with any relevant working groups. 
</p>

<p>Target deliverable is the document Arabic Layout Requirements.</p>


<h3>Milestones</h3>

<p>Plans for the main document deliverable are as follows. All deliverables will be made available in English.</p>

</tbody></table>
    <p>Other deliverables may be produced on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the charter, and the specific topics to be addressed by the task force and schedule information cannot be determined far in advance, but are driven by the needs of the Web community.</div>

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

<p>The success of the Task Force will be evaluated based on how productively it engages with W3C members and the relevant script communities  to promote discussion of specifications that affect layout and presentation of  languages  on the Web, and how effectively it is able to produce additional documents for the refinement, implementation, and adoption of  text layout and related technologies in Arabic.</p>
</div>

<div class="dependencies">
<h2 id="coordination">Relationships to External Groups</h2>

<p>Working Drafts and Notes will be published by the i18n WG, and the i18n WG will work with the task force closely to assist with development and review of the documents.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>The Arabic Text Layout Task Force has no formal dependencies on any  W3C Working Groups other than the Internationalization Working Group. Important points of contact are:</dt>

    <dd>The Arabic Text Layout Task Force is also expected to take advantage of opportunities for discussion and collaboration with existing groups and communities in Arabic-script countries as well as groups and communities elsewhere.</dd> 
</dl>
</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>To be successful, the Arabic Text Layout Task Force is expected to have  participation, for its duration, from a representative section of the typographic and digital text publishing communities for each of the main languages covered. Effective participation in the Arabic Text Layout Task Force is expected to consume up to one work day per week for each participant; two days per week for editors.</p>

<p>Participants are reminded of the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">Good
Standing requirements</a> of the W3C Process.</p>
</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>Arabic Text Layout Task Force discussions take place via email, and face-to-face meetings may be called at locations that are convenient to participants in the project. Any publications or other reports eventually contributed by the Task Force back to the W3C will be made available in  English. (Translations may be produced in addition to the English version, but the English version will remain the authoritative version.)</p>
<p>The task force  reaches out to the wider international community with discussions and announcements in English on the  public-i18n-arabic@w3.org list (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-arabic/">archive</a>). That list will be used for technical discussions, where necessary, but the group will use github issues to handle most technical or editorial comments and discussions. The public-i18n-arabic@w3.org list must archive or point to minutes and summaries of all teleconferences and face-to-face meetings. Meeting minutes will list all attendees at a given meeting.</p>
<p>An administrative list, public-i18n-alreq-admin, will also be used for internal communication about practical matters, such as meeting agenda, which should be published before each teleconference or face-to-face meeting.</p>

<p>The group will use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/"> Internationalization Activity home page </a>to provide updated public information about its activities.
</p>

<p> Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a
href="../i18n-wg/">Internationalization  Working Group</a> home page and from the <a href="index">home page of the Task Force</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p>As explained in the Process Document (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>),
this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. In cases where there is a need to formally produce a group resolution about a particular issue, its Chair will put a question about the issue to the group and gather responses (including any formal objections); then, after due consideration of all the responses, the Chair will record a group resolution (possibly after a formal vote and also along with responding to any formal objections).</p>
</div>

<div class="patent">
<h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Policy </h2>

<p>Participants in the Arabic Text Layout Task Force are obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy as outlined  inÂ <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section 6</a>Â of the W3C Patent Policy document. Although the Arabic Text Layout Task Force is not chartered to produce Recommendation-track documents that themselves require patent disclosure, participants in the group are nevertheless obligated to comply with W3C patent-disclosure policy for any Recommendation-track specifications that they review or comment on.</p>
