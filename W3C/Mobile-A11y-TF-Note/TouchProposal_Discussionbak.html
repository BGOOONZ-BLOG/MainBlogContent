  <h4>Lively discussion on list. Here's it is after redundancies etc. removed</h4>
     <p  class="blue"> <strong>Patrick Lauke: </strong>"touch" is not strictly a "mobile" issue. There are already many devices   (2-in-1 tablet/laptops, desktop machines with external touch-capable   monitors, etc) beyond the mobile space which include touch interaction.   So, a fundamental question for me would be: would these extensions be   signposted/labelled as being "mobile-specific", or will they be added to   WCAG 2 core in a more general, device-agnostic manner? Further, though I welcome the addition of SCs relating to touch target   size and clearance, I'm wondering why we would not also have the   equivalent for mouse or stylus interfaces...again, in short, why make it   touch-specific, when in general the SCs should apply to all "pointers"   ("mouse cursor, pen, touch (including multi-touch), or other pointing   input device", to borrow some wording from the Pointer Events spec <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/</a>)? </p>
  <p class="blue"> <strong>Detlev: </strong>Hi Patrick, I didn't intend this first draft to be restricted to
        touch ony devices - just capturing that input mode‎. It's certainly
        good to capture input commonalities where they exist (e.g., activate
        elements on touchend/mouseup)<br>
        </p>
     
  <p class="blue">
      <strong>Patrick:</strong> Or, even better, just relying on the high-level focus/blur/click ones   (though even for focus/blur, most touch AT don't fire them when you'd   expect them - see <a href="http://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/tests/results/#mobile-tablet-touchscreen-assistive-technology-events" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/tests/results/#mobile-tablet-touchscreen-assistive-technology-events</a> and particularly <a href="http://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/tests/results/#desktop-touchscreen-assistive-technology-events" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/tests/results/#desktop-touchscreen-assistive-technology-events</a> where none of the tested touchscreen AT trigger a focus when moving to a control)
      <p class="blue"><strong>Jonathan Avila:</strong> Regarding touch start and end -- we are thinking of access without AT by   people with motor impairments who may tap the wrong control before   sliding to locate the correct control. This is new and different than sc   3.2.x. I understand and have seen what you say about focus events and no key events so that is a separate matter to address</p>

  <p class="blue" ><strong>Detlev Fischer:</strong> - but then there are touch-specific
    things, not just touch target size as mentioned by Alan, but also<br>
    touch gestures without mouse equivalent. Swiping - split-tapping -
    long presses - rotate gestures - cursed L-shaped gestures, etc.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Patrick:</strong> It's probably worth being careful about distinguishing between gestures   that the *system / AT* provides, and which are then translated into   high-level events (e.g. swiping left/right which a mobile AT will   interpret itself and move the focus accordingly) and gestures that are   directly handled via JavaScript (with touch and pointer events specific   code) - also keeping in mind that the latter can't be done by default   when using a touchscreen AT unless the user explicitly triggers some   form of gesture passthrough.</p>
<p  class="blue"><strong>Detlev:</strong> That's a good point. Thinking of the perspective of an AT user carrying   out an accessibility test, or even any non-programmer carrying out a   heuristic accessibility evaluation using browser toolbars and things   like Firebug, I wonder what is implied in making that distinction, and   how it might be reflected in documented test procedures.<br>
Are we getting to the point where it becomes impossible to carry out   accessibility tests without investigating in detail the chain of events   fired?<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Patrick: </strong>For the former, the fact that the focus is moved sequentially using a   swipe left/right rather than a TAB/SHIFT+TAB does not cause any new   issues not covered, IMHO, by the existing keyboard-specific SCs if   instead of keyboard it talked in more input agnostic terms. Same for not   trapping focus etc.</p>
<p class="blue"><strong>Detlev:</strong> One important difference being that swiping on mobile also gets to   non-focusable elements. While a script may keep keyboard focus safely   inside a pop-up window, a SR user may swipe beyond that pop-up unawares   (unless the page background has been given the aria-hidden treatment,   and that may not work everywhere as intended). Also, it may be easier to   reset focus on a touch interface (e.g. 4-finger tap on iOS) compared to   getting out of a keyboard trap if a keyboard is all you can use to   interact.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Patrick: </strong>For the latter, though, I agree that this would be touch (not mobile   though) specific...and advice should be given that custom gestures may   be difficult/impossible to even trigger for certain users (even for   single touch gestures, and even more so for multitouch ones).</p>
<p class="blue"><strong>Detlev:</strong> Assuming a non-expert perspective (say, product manager, company   stategist), when looking at Principle 2 Operable it would be quite   intelligible to talk about<br>
2.1 Keyboard Accessible<br>
2.5 Touch Accessible<br>
2.6 Pointer Accessible (It's not just Windows and Android with KB, Blackberry has a pointer too)<br>
2.7 Voice Accessible<br>
<br>
While the input modes touch and pointer share many aspects and (as you   show) touch events are actually mapped onto mouse events, there might be   enough differences to warrant different Guidelines.<br>
For example, you are right that there is no reason why target size and   clearance should not also be defined for pointer input, but the actual   values would probably be slightly lower in a "Pointer accessible"   Guideline. A pointer is a) more pointed (sigh) and therefore more   precise and b) does not obliterate its target in the same way as a   finger tip.<br>
Another example: A SC for touch might address multi-touch gestures,   mouse has no swipe gesture. SCs under Touch accessible may also cover   two input modes: default (direct interaction) and the two-phase indirect   interaction of focusing, then activating, when the screenreader is   turned on.<br>
<br>
Of course it might be more elegant to just make Guideline 2.1 input mode   agnostic, but I wonder whether the resulting abstraction would be   intelligible to designers and testers. I think it would be worthwhile to take a stab at *just drafting* an   input-agnostic Guideline 2.1 "Operable in any mode" and draft SC below,   to get a feel what tweaking core WCAG might look like, and how Success   criteria and techniques down the line may play out. Interfaces catering for both mouse   and touch input often lead to horrible, abject usability. Watch low   vision touch users swear at Windows 8 (metro) built-in magnification via   indirect input on sidebars (an abomination probably introduced because   mice don't know how to pinch-zoom). Watch Narrator users struggle when   swipe gestures get too close to the edge and unintendedly reveal the   charms bar or those bottom and top slide-in bars in apps. Similar things   happen when Blackberry screenreader users unintentionally trigger the   common swipes from the edges which BB thought should be retained even   with screenreader on. And finally, watch mouse users despair as they   cannot locate a close button in a metro view because it is only revealed   when they move the mouse right to the top edge of the screen.</p>
<p class="blue"><strong>Mike Pluke:</strong> I&rsquo;d   personally prefer something like &ldquo;character input interface&rdquo; [instead of keyboard interface] to further   break the automatic assumption that we are talking about   keyboards or other things with keys on them.  
<p class="blue"><strong>Gregg Vanderheiden</strong>: This note is great
     
<ul class="blue">
  <li>Note   1: A keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to   programs even if the native technology does not contain a keyboard. </li>
</ul class="blue">
<p class="blue">I would add a note 2</p>
<ul class="blue">
  <li class="blue">Note 2: full control form a keyboard interface allows control from any   input modality since it is modality agnostic.  It can allow control from   speech, Morse code, sip and puff, eye gaze, gestures, and augmentative   communication aid or any other device or software program that can take   (any type) of user input and convert it into keystrokes.   Full control   from keyboard interface is to input what text is to output.  Text can be   presented in any sensory modality.   Keyboard interface input can be   produced by software using any input modality.</li>
</ul>
  <p class="blue">RE &ldquo;character input interface&rdquo;</p>
<ul class="blue">
      <li class="blue">
      we thought of that but you need more than the characters on the   keyboard.  You also need arrow keys and return and escape etc. </li>
      
      <li class="blue">we thought of encoded input (but that is greek)  and ascii (but that is   not international) or UNICODE  (but that is undefined and really   geeky) </li>
</ul>
<p class="blue"><strong>Jonathan: </strong>While   I agree the term [Keyboard Interface] is misleading, In desktop terms testing with a   physical keyboard is one good way to make sure the keyboard interface is   working. Even   on mobile devices, support a physical keyboard through the keyboard   interface is something that helps people with disabilities and is an   important test. <em><strong> It just doesn&rsquo;t   go far enough.</strong></em><strong></strong>
<p class="blue"><strong>David MacDonald:</strong> +1 to &quot;it doesn't go far enough.&quot;
However, </p></div>
<div class="comment">
<strong>David Macdonald Summary Comment: </strong>I think this discussion demonstrates that requiring <strong>ALL</strong> functionality to work with touch will be difficult. I don't think that we should require that &quot;all functionality&quot; be available via touch because:
<ol>
  <li>It may not be possible. </li>
  <li>It may not apply on ALL cases to ALL mobile sites. </li>
  <li>I think we have to assume that normal usabililty practices will ensure that mobile apps will be primarily touch functioning.</li>
</ol>
However, the accessibility gap is that deveopers don't ensure that someone running assistive technology can ALSO operate the system with touch. This is 2.5.4 below. </div>
<p class="blue"><strong>David: </strong>How about this for a Guideline under which all the other touch events can be placed?</p>
<div class="guideline"><strong>Guideline 2.5 Touch Accessible:</strong> Make it easier for users to operate touch functionality (Understanding)</div>
<p class="blue"><strong>David: </strong>This provides a nice wide guideline under which we can place our Success Criteria and Techniques and it echos the language of the existing Guidelines. (i.e., Guideline 1.4)</p>
<p class="blue"><strong>Patrick: </strong>Sure, but this SC would be relegated into the "touch/mobile" extension   to WCAG, which somebody designing a desktop/mouse site may look into   (again, going back to the fundamental problem of WCAG extension, but I   digress).
<p class="blue"><strong>David:</strong> WCAG 2 is a stable document, entrenched in many jurisdictional laws,   which is a good thing. So far, unless something drastically changes in   consensus or in the charter approval, the extension model is what we are   looking at. However,   we may want to explore the idea of incorporating all these   recommendations into failure techniques or sufficient techniques for   *existing* Success Criteria in WCAG core, which would ensure they get   first class treatment in WCAG proper. This would ensure that they are   not left out of jurisdictions that didn't add the extension. But some of   the placement in existing Success Criteria could be pretty contrived.   Most would probably end up in 1.3.1 (like everything else).
<div class="comment"><strong>David Summary:</strong><strong>I   think it is worth weighing hard the pros and cons of rolling these into   WCAG core vs. adding Success Criteria and Guidelines in this extension.
  </div>
<h3>New Proposed <strong>Success Criteria</strong> under this proposed Guideline    </h3>
    <div class="newsuccesscriteria"><strong>2.5.1 Touch:</strong> All functionality of the content is operable through touch  gestures. (Level A)</div>
    <div class="prefix">
      <blockquote>
        <p class="blue"><strong>David: </strong>Is this applicable on all mobile site? See comment above.</p>
        <p class="blue"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> But   we still need an exception like we have for keyboard access for things   like drawing and signatures, etc.  So we need to take into timing and   paths, etc.  Except when the   touch interactions requires specific timing or path...Perhaps pulling out similar language that is related to the keyboard success criteria about timing and paths. </p>
        <div class="newsuccesscriteria"><strong>2.5.1 Touch: </strong>All <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html#functiondef" target="_blank">functionality</a> of   the content is operable through a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html#keybrd-interfacedef" target="_blank">touch   interface</a> without requiring specific timings for individual   touch gestures, except where the underlying function requires   input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the   endpoints. (Level A)</div>
        <p class="blue"> <strong>David:</strong>I think we are overreaching by requiring EVERYTHING to work with touch. I think we want to stick with requiring that anything that DOES operate via touch, can be used by a variety of users, including those with touch based screen readers.
      I think we can drop this and be more granular as with the other Success Criteria below.        
        <p class="blue"><strong>Gregg:</strong>         Not posible or practical: an Apple watch – all the physical controls on the side have to also be operable from the screen?    Or do you mean that a web page designer needs to  provide their own keyboard in their content for any keyboard input on their page? I’m not sure this makes sense.   If you are relying on the keyboard interface for input of text – then it is not all via touch – some is via the keyboard interface.         And some mobile devices don’t have an onscreen keyboard (they have a physical one)  – so all by touch means you AGAIN WOULD have to provide all the input with a keyboard built into each web page or you would fail this SC<br>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="newsuccesscriteria"> <strong>2.5.2 Touch Target Size:</strong> One dimension of any touch target measures at least 9       mm except when the user has reduced the default scale of content. (Level       AA)</div>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="blue"><strong>Gregg: </strong>What good is one dimension??  If you have any physical disability you need to specify both dimensions. 
        
        ALSO – for what size screen.   An apple watch?    An iphone 4?  All buttons would have to be huge in order to comply on very small screens – and you don’t know what size screen – so you can’t use absolute measures unless you assume smallest screen. 
        
      </p>
      <p class="blue"><strong>Patrick:</strong> - Gregg's question about 9mm - it would be good to clarify if we mean   *physical* mm, or CSS mm. Note that many guidelines (such as Google's   guidelines for Android, or Microsoft's app design guidelines) use   measurements such as dips (device independents pixels) precisely to   avoid having to deal with differences in actual physical device   dimensions (as it's the device/OS' responsibility to map its actual   physical size to a reasonable dips measure, so authors can take that as a   given that is reasonably uniform across devices). - on a more general level, I questioned why there should be an SC   relating to target size for *touch*, but that there's no equivalent SC   for mouse or stylus interaction? </p>
      <p class="blue"><strong>Jon:</strong> My guess is that touch target size would need to be larger than a   mouse pointer touch area -- so the touch target would catch those as   well.</p>
      <p class="blue"><strong>Patrick:</strong> Too small a target size can be just as   problematic for users with tremors, mobility impairments, reduced   dexterity, etc.</p>
      <p class="blue"><strong>Jon </strong>That's exactly who this SC is aimed at.  This SC is not   specifically aimed at screen reader users or low vision users but people   with motor impairments.</p>
      <p class="blue"><strong>Patrick:</strong>  I know it's not the remit of the TF, but I'd argue that   this is exactly the sort of thing that would benefit from being a   generalised SC applicable to all manner of pointing interaction (mouse,   pen, touch, etc). Or is the expectation that there will be a separate TF   for "pen and stylus TF", "mouse interaction TF", etc? (these two points also apply to 2.5.5)<strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    </blockquote>
<div class="newsuccesscriteria"> <strong>2.5.3 Single Taps and Long Presses Revocable:</strong> Interface elements that require a  single tap or a long press as input will only trigger the corresponding event  when the finger is lifted inside that element. (Level A)</div>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="blue">
          <strong> Patrick:</strong></strong> I like the concept, but the wording that follows (requiring that things only trigger if touch point is still wihin the same element) is overly specific/limiting in my view. Also, it is partly out of the developer's control. For instance, in current iOS and Android, touch events have a magic "auto-capture" behavior: you can start a touch sequence on an element, move your touch point outside of the element, and release it...it will still fire touchmove/touchend events (but not click, granted). Pointer Events include an explicit feature to capture pointers and to emulate the same behavior as touch events. However, it would be possible to make taps/long presses revocable by, for instance, prompting the user with a confirmation dialog as a result of a tap/press (if the action is significant/destructive in particular). This would still fulfill the "revocable" requirement, just in a different way to "must be lifted inside the element".
          
          In short: I'd keep the principle of "revocable" actions, but would not pin down the "the finger (touch point, whatever...keeping it a bit more agnostic) is lifted inside the element".</p>
        <p class="blue"><strong>Gregg: </strong>This will make interfaces unusable by some people who cannot reliably land and release within the same element. Also it is only a relatively small number that know about this. Also if someone hits something by mistake – they usually don’t have the motor control to use this approach. Better is the ability to reverse or undo.  I think that is already in WCAG though – with caveats. <br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

    <div class="newsuccesscriteria"> <strong>2.5.4 Modified Touch:</strong></strong> When touch input behavior is modified by built-in  assistive technology, all functionality of the content is still operable  through touch gestures. (Level A)</div>
<blockquote>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Gregg: </strong> You have no control of how it is changed – so how can you be expected to have anything still work? </p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>David MacDonald:</strong> How about this: 
  <div class="newsuccesscriteria"><strong>2.5.4 Touch:</strong> For pages and applications that support touch, all functionality of the content is operable through touch gestures with and without system assistive technology activated. (Level A)</div>
     </p>
     <p class="blue"><strong>David:</strong> In the understanding document for this SC we would explain that touch   gestures with VO on could be and probably would be the VO equivalent to   the standard gestures used with VO off.</p>
     <p class="blue"><strong>Patrick:</strong> As it's not possible to recognise gestures when VoiceOver is enabled, as VO intercepts gestures for its own purposes
        (similar to how desktop AT intercept key presses) unless the user
        explicitly uses a pass-through gesture, does this imply that interfaces
        need to be made to also work just with an activation/double-tap ? i.e.,
        does double-tap count in this context as a "gesture"? If not, it's not
        technically possible for web pages to force pass-through (no equivalent
        to role="application" for desktop/keyboard handling).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>David: </strong>VO uses gestures for its own purposes and then adds gestures to
        substitute for those it replaced i.e., VO 3 finger swipe= 1 finger
        swipe. I'm suggesting that we require everything that can be accomplished with VO
        off with gestures can be accomplished with VO on.<br>
     </p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Patrick: </strong>Not completely, though. If I build my own gesture recognition from basic   principles (tracking the various touchstart/touchmove/touchend events),   the only way that gesture can be passed on to the JS when VO is   activated is if the user performs a pass-through gesture, followed by   the actual gesture I'm detecting via JS. Technically, this means that   yes, even VO users can make any arbitrary gesture detected via JS, but   in practice, it's - in my mind - more akin to mouse-keys (in that yes, a   keyboard user can nominally use any mouse-specific interface by using   mouse keys on their keyboard, just as a touch-AT user can perform any   custom gesture...but it's more of a last resort, rather than standard   operation). Also, not sure if Android/TalkBack, Windows Mobile/Narrator have these   sorts of pass-through gestures (even for iOS/VO, it's badly   documented...no mention of it that I could find on any official Apple   sites). In short, to me this still makes it lean more towards providing all   functionality in other, more traditional ways (which would then also   work for mobile/tablet users with an external keyboard/keyboard-like   interface). Gestures can be like shortcuts for touch users, but should   not replace more traditional buttons/widgets, IMHO. This may be a user   setting perhaps? Choose if the interface should just rely on touch   gestures, or provide additional focusable/actionable controls?
      </p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> I also worry that people might try to say that pass through gestures would meet this requirement.</p>
     <p class="blue"><strong>David:</strong> How could we fix this concern? I think WCAG 2.1.1 already covers the need for keyboard use (without   mouseKeys). We could maybe plug the hole so the pass   through gesture is not relied on by the author the same way we do in   2.1.1 not relying on MouseKeys..</p>
    <p class="blue"> <strong>Patrick:</strong> does this imply that interfaces need to be made to   also work just with an activation/double-tap ? i.e., does double-tap   count in this context as a "gesture"?      
  <p class="blue"><strong>Jonathan: </strong>In theory I think this would benefit people from prosthetics too.  For   example, many apps support zoom by double tapping without requiring a   pinch.  You should be able to control all actions from touch (e.g.   through an API) and also through the keyboard.  But I think it would be   too constrictive to require on tap, double tap, long tap, etc.  Since   screen readers and the API support actions through rotors and other   gestures it would seem that API based and keyboard access would be   sufficient.  But you bring up a good point that while this might make   sense on native -- but mobile web apps don't have a good way without   Indie UI to expose actions to the native assistive technologies.  This   is a key area that needs to be addressed by other groups and perhaps may   be addressed by other options such as WAPA -- but we do need to be   careful and perform some research as the abilities we need may not be   yet supported or part of a mature enough specification.</p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>David:</strong> It would be great to operate everything through taps... even creating a   Morse code type of thing, where all gestures could be done with taps   for those who can't swipe, but it would require a lot more functionality   than is currently available.  I think we should park it, and perhaps   provide it as a best practise technique under this Success Criteria.</p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Gregg:</strong> do they have a way to map screen readers gestures [to avoid] colliding special gestures in apps? this   was not to replace use of gestures — but to provide a simple alternate   way to get at them if you can&rsquo;t make them (physically can&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t   because of collisions)  </p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Patrick:</strong> Not to my knowledge. iOS does have some form of gesture recording with Assistive Touch, but I   can't seem to get it to play ball in combination with VoiceOver, and in   the specific case of web content (though this may be my inexperience   with this feature). On Android/Win Mobile side, I don't think there's   anything comparable, so certainly no cross-platform, cross-AT mechanism.</p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Jonathan: </strong>This   is only one aspect of the situation.    It&rsquo;s not so much as colliding   gestures rather than a collision of how the touch interface is   reconfigured to trap gestures combined   with the issue of not being able to see where the gesture is being   drawn. For iOS native apps, there is:<u></u><u></u></p>
  <ul class="blue">
        <li><u></u><u></u>an   actions API that allows apps to associate custom actions with an   actions rotor or assign a default action to a magic tap gesture<u></u><u></u></li>
        <li><u></u>a pass through gesture –tap and hold and then perform the gestures.<u></u><u></u></li>
        <li><u></u>A   trait that can be assigned that will allow direct UI interaction with   the element – allowing screen reader users the ability to sign there   name, etc.</li>
      </ul>
  <p class="blue">Take for example a hypothetical knob on a webpage.  Without a screen
        reader I can turn that knob to specific settings.  As a developer I can
        implement keystrokes, let&rsquo;s say control+1, control+2, etc. for the
        different settings.  I have met the letter of the success criteria by
        providing a keyboard interface through creating JavaScript shortcut
        keystroke listeners.  In practical reality though as a mobile screen<br>
        reader user who does not carry around a keyboard I have no way to
        trigger those keystrokes.<br>
      </p>
  <p class="blue"> <strong>Patrick:</strong> Actually, it gets worse than that. As I noted previously, not all   mobile/tablet devices with a paired keyboard actually send keyboard   (keydown, keypress) events all the time.   In iOS, with a paired keyboard (but no VO enabled), the keyboard is   completely inactive except when the user is in a text entry field or   similar (basically, it only works in the same situations in which iOS'   on-screen keyboard would be triggered).    When VO is enabled, the keyboard still only sends keyboard events when   in a text entry field etc. In all other situations, every keystroke is   intercepted by VO (and again, there is no mechanism to override this   with role="application" or similar). 
     In short, for iOS you can't rely on anything that listens for keydown/keypress either.  In Android, the situations is more similar to what would happen on   desktop (from what I recall at least...would need to do some further   testing) in that the keyboard always works/fires key events. Not had a   chance to test Windows Mobile with paired keyboard yet, but I suspect it   works in a similar way.       
     <p class="blue"><strong>David: </strong> We never envisioned in the years 2000-2008 when we were tying up WCAG    people who are blind using a flat screen to operate a mobile device.    I think it was a huge leap forward for our industry, and we need to   foster their relationship to their devices, and run with it. Keyboard   requirements are in place, they are not going away. <em><strong>Our job now is to   look at the gaps, and see if there is anything we can do to ensure these   users can continue to use their flat screens which has levelled the   playing field for the blind, and to foster authoring that doesn't screw   that up. </strong></em><strong></strong>
      
     <p class="blue">Here's a rewrite with addressing the concerns.    
  <div class="newsuccesscriteria"><strong>2.5.4 Touch:</strong> For pages and applications that support touch, all functionality of the content is operable through touch   gestures with and without system assistive technology activated, without relying on pass through gestures on the system (Level   A) </div>
  
  <div>
    <div aria-label="Show trimmed content" data-tooltip="Show trimmed content" id=":1u9" role="button" tabindex="0"><img src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif"></div></div>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Patrick:</strong> As said, when touch AT is running, all gestures are intercepted by the   AT at the moment (unless you mean taps?). And only iOS, to my knowledge,   has a passthrough gesture (which is not announced/exposed to users, so a   user would have to guess that if they tried it, something would then   happen).<br>
    If the intention was to also mean "taps", this is lost on me and   possibly the majority of devs, as "gesture" usually implies a swipe,   pinch, rotation, etc, which are all intercepted. [ED: skimming towards   the end of the document, I see that in 3.3 Touchscreen Gestures "taps"   are listed here. This, to me - and I'd argue most other devs - is   confusing...I don't normally think of a "tap" as a "gesture"] So this SC (at least the "touch gestures with ... assistive technology   activated") part is currently technically *impossible* to satisfy (for   anything other than taps), except by not using gestures or by providing   alternatives to gestures like actionable buttons.<br>
This can be clarified in the prose for the SC, but perhaps a better way   would be to drop the "gestures" word, and then the follow-up about   passthrough, leaving a much simpler/clearer:<br>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="blue"><strong>"2.5.4 Touch: </strong>For pages and applications that support touch, all   functionality of the content is operable through touch with and without   system assistive technology activated (Level A)"  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="blue">I'm even wondering about the "For pages and applications that support   touch" preamble...why have it here? Every other SC relating to touch   should then also have it, for consistency? Or perhaps just drop that bit   too?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="blue"> <strong>"2.5.4 Touch: </strong>All functionality of the content is operable through touch   with and without system assistive technology activated (Level A)"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="blue">OR is the original intent of this SC to be in fact</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="blue"> <strong>"2.5.4 Touch:</strong> For pages and applications that support touch *GESTURES*,   all functionality of the content is operable through touch gestures with   and without system assistive technology activated, without relying on   pass through gestures on the system (Level A)"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="blue">is this about gestures? In that case, it's definitely technically   impossible to satisfy this SC at all currently (see above), so I'd be   strongly opposed to it.</p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Detlev:</strong> Maybe it's better to separate the discussion of terminology from the discussion of reworking the mobile TF Doc.<br>
I personally don't get why someone would choose to call swiping or   pinching a gesture, but refuse to apply this term to tapping. What about   double and triple taps? Taps with two fingers? Long presses? Split   taps? To me, it makes sense to call *all* finger actions applied to a touch   screen a gesture. I simply don't get why tapping would not count. Where   do you draw the line, and why? A related issue is the distinction between touch gestures and button   presses. With virtual (non-tactile, but fixed position capacitive)   buttons, you already get into a grey area. The drafted Guideline 2.5   "Touch Accessible: All functionality available via touch" probably needs   to be expanded to include account for devices with physical (both   tactile or capacitive) device buttons. Which would mean something like </p>
  <div class="newsuccesscriteria"><strong>Guideline 2.5 OR SC 2.5.4: </strong>On devices that support touch input, all functions are available vie   touch or button presses also after AT is turned on (i.e. without the use   of external keyboards).  </div>
  <p class="blue"><strong>Detlev</strong>: <span class="newsuccesscriteria">Not well put, but you get the idea.</span></p>
  <p class="blue"><strong>David:</strong>  I think when we say Touch, we mean all touch activities such as swipes, taps, gestures etc... anything you do to operate the page by <strong><em>touching</em></strong> it. Regarding gestures, all   gestures are intercepted by VoiceOver. But all standard gestures are replaced by VoiceOver, unless   the author does something dumb to break that. I think we need to, at a   minimum, ensure that standard replacement gestures are not messed up. For   instance: I recently tested a high profile app for a major sports   event. It had a continuous load feature like twitter that kept   populating as you scroll down with one finger. Turn on the VoiceOver and   try the 3 finger equivalent of a one finger swipe to do a standard scroll and nothing happens to populate   the page. The blind user has hit a brick wall. I think we have to ensure   this type of thing doesn't happen on WCAG conforming things.  </p>

&nbsp;</h3>
<p class="blue"><strong>Patrick: </strong>  Agree with Gregg this is not a web content issue as currently stated.   Also, not every orientation change needs something like an alert to the   user...what if nothing actually changes on the page when switching   between portrait and landscape - does an AT user need to know that they   just rotated the device? Perhaps the intent here is to ensure web content notifies the user if an   orientation change had some effect, like a complete change in layout   (for instance, a tab navigation in landscape turning into an accordion   in portrait; a navigation bar in landscape turning into a   button+dropdown in portrait)? If so, this needs rewording, along similar   lines to a change in context?
<p class="blue"><strong>Jon: </strong>Yes, that is the intention.  For example, if you change from   landscape to portrait a set of links disappears and now there is a   button menu instead.  Or controls disappear or appear depending on the   orientation.
<h3>New Possible techniques for Success Criteria 3.2.3</h3>
    <div class="technique"> If the navigation bar is   collapsed into a single icon, the entries in the drop-down list that   appear when activating the icon are still in the same relative order as the full navigation menu. </div>

<div class="technique"> A Web site, when viewed on the different screen sizes and in   different orientations, has some components that are hidden or appear in   a different order. The components that show, however, remain consistent   for any screen size and orientation. </div>
    <h3>New Techniques for 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions</h3>
<div class="technique">Therefore, instructions (e.g. overlays, tooltips, tutorials, etc.)   should be provided to explain what gestures can be used to control a   given interface and whether there are alternatives. </div>

    </p>
  <p class="blue"> <strong>Gregg:</strong> It SHOULD be required.  But it is already covered by “all functions from keyboard interface” since that would provide an alternate method.   So there is already an alternate way to do this. 


NOTE:  again – for some devices –it may not be possible to have something be accessible.   

A broach that you tap on – and ask questions and it answers in audio – would not be usable by someone who is deaf.   They fact that you can’t make it usable – would not be a reason to rewrite the accessibility rules to make it possible for it to pass.   It simply would always be inaccessible.   Accessibility rules do not say that everything must be accessible to all. They say that if it is reasonable or not an undue burden or some such – then  it needs to do x or y or z.     Some things are not required to be accessible to some groups.  That does not make them accessible – it only means they are not required to be accessible. 

RE keyboard interface – there may be some IOT devices that do not have remote interfaces – and the iot device itself is too small or limited to be accessible.  We don’t rewrite the rules to make it possible for it to pass.  We simply say that it is not accessible  and it is not possible or reasonable to do so.  

Most IOT does have a remote interface –so that can be accessible. </p>

        <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
        <p>This document provides informative guidance (but does not set   requirements) with regard to interpreting and applying Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 [WCAG20] to web and non-web mobile   content and applications. </p>
        <p>While the World Wide Web Consortium (<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>)'s <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web Accessibility   Initiative (WAI) is primarily concerned with web technologies, guidance   for web-based technologies is also often relevant to non-web   technologies. The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>-WAI has published the Note <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/">Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)</a> to provide authoritative guidance on how to apply WCAG to non-web   technologies such as mobile native applications. The current document is   a mobile-specific extension of this effort. </p>
        <p><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/">Mobile Web Initiative</a> Recommendations and Notes pertaining to mobile technologies also include the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/">Mobile Web Best Practices</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp/">Mobile Web Application Best Practices</a>.   These offer general guidance to developers on how to create content and   applications that work well on mobile devices. The current document is   focused on the accessibility of mobile web and applications to people   with disabilities and is not intended to supplant any other <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> work. </p>

          </h3>
          <p><em>"Mobile"</em> is a generic term for a broad range of wireless   devices and applications that are easy to carry and use in a wide   variety of settings, including outdoors. Mobile devices range from small   handheld devices (e.g. feature phones, smartphones) to somewhat larger   tablet devices. The term also applies to <em>"wearables"</em> such as   "smart"-glasses, "smart"-watches and fitness bands, and is relevant to   other small computing devices such as those embedded into car   dashboards, airplane seatbacks, and household appliances. </p>
          <p>While mobile is viewed by some as separate from <em>"desktop/laptop"</em>,   and thus perhaps requiring new and different accessibility guidance, in   reality there is no absolute divide between the categories. For   example: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>many desktop/laptop devices now include touchscreen gesture control, </li>
            <li>many mobile devices can be connected to an external keyboard and mouse, </li>
            <li>web pages utilizing responsive design can transition into a "mobile" screen size even on a desktop/laptop, and </li>
            <li>mobile operating systems have been used for laptop devices. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Furthermore, the vast majority of user interface patterns from   desktop/laptop systems (e.g. text, hyperlinks, tables, buttons, pop-up   menus, etc.) are equally applicable to mobile. Therefore, it's not   surprising that a large number of existing WCAG 2.0 techniques can be   applied to mobile content and applications (see Appendix A). Overall, <strong>WCAG 2.0 is highly relevant to both web and non-web mobile content and applications</strong>. </p>
          <p>That said, mobile devices do present a mix of accessibility   issues that are different from the typical desktop/laptop. The   "Discussion of Mobile-Related Issues" section, below, explains how these   issues can be addressed in the context of WCAG 2.0 as it exists or with   additional best practices. All the advice in this document can be   applied to mobile web sites, mobile web applications, and hybrid   web-native applications. Most of the advice also applies to native   applications (also known as "mobile apps"). </p>
          <p><em>Note:</em> WCAG 2.0 does not provide testable success criteria   for some of the mobile-related issues. The work of the Mobile   Accessibility Task Force has been to develop techniques and best   practices in these areas. When the techniques or best practices don't   map to specific WCAG success criteria, they aren't given a sufficient,   advisory or failure designation. This doesn't mean that they are   optional for creating accessible web content on a mobile platform, but   rather that they cannot currently be assigned a designation. The Task   Force anticipates that some of these techniques will be included as   sufficient or advisory in a potential future iteration of WCAG. </p>
          <p>The current document references existing WCAG 2.0 Techniques that   apply to mobile platform (see Appendix A) and provides new best   practices, which may in the future become WCAG 2.0 Techniques that   directly address emerging mobile accessibility challenges such as small   screens, touch and gesture interface, and changing screen orientation. </p>

              </span></h3>
              <p>Small screen size is one of the most common characteristics of mobile devices. While the exceptional resolution of these screens theoretically enables large amounts of information to be rendered, the small size of the screen places practical limits on how much information people can actually view at one time, especially when magnification is used by people with low vision. </p>
              <p>Accessibility features geared toward specific populations of people with   disabilities fall under the definition of assistive technology adopted   by WCAG and thus cannot be relied upon to meet the success criteria.    For example, a platform-level zoom feature that magnifies all platform   content and has features to specifically support people with low vision   is likely considered an assistive technology. </p>

            <h3><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">2.2 </span>Zoom/Magnification</span><br>
            </h3>
            <p>A variety of methods allow the user to control content size on mobile devices with small screens. At the browser level these methods are generally available to assist a wide audience of users. At the platform level these methods are available as accessibility features to serve people with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities.</p>
            <p>The methods include the following: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>OS-level features
                <ul>
                  <li> Set default text size (typically controlled from the Display Settings) <em>Note</em>: System text size is often not supported by mobile browsers. </li>
                  <li> Magnify entire screen (typically controlled from the Accessibility Settings). <em>Note</em>: Using this setting requires the user to pan vertically and horizontally. </li>
                  <li> Magnifying lens view under user's finger (typically controlled from the Accessibility Settings) </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Browser-level features
                <ul>
                  <li> Set default text size of text rendered in the browser's viewport
                    <ul>
                      <li> Reading mode that renders main content at a user-specified text size </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li> Magnify browser's viewport (typically "pinch-zoom"). <em>Note</em>: Using this setting requires the user to pan vertically and horizontally.
                    <ul>
                      <li><em>Note</em>: Some browsers have features that might modify this type   of magnification (e.g. re-flowing the content at the new magnification   level, overriding author attempts to prevent pinch-zoom). </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="successcriteria"> <strong>1.4.4 Resize text</strong> (Level AA) </div>
            <p>SC 1.4.4 requires text to be resizable without assistive technology up to 200 percent. To meet this requirement content must not prevent text magnification by the user.</p>
            <p><em>Note:</em> Relying on full viewport zooming (e.g. not blocking the browser's pinch       zoom feature) requires the user to pan horizontally as well as vertically.       While this technique meets the success criteria it is less usable than       supporting text resizing features that reflow content to the user's chosen       viewport size. It is best practice to use techniques that support text       resizing without requiring horizontal panning. </p>

            <p>Mobile devices are more likely than desktop/laptop devices to be used in   varied environments including outdoors, where glare from the sun or   other strong lighting sources is more likely.  This scenario heightens   the importance of use of good contrast for all users and may compound   the challenges that users with low vision have accessing content with   poor contrast on mobile devices. </p>
            <p>The WCAG 2.0 success criteria related to the issue of contrast are: </p>
            <div class="successcriteria">
              <ul>

                <li> <strong>1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)</strong> (Level AAA) which requires a contrast of at least 7:1 (or 4.5:1 for large-scale text). </li>

            <p>SC 1.4.3. allows for different contrast ratios for large text.    Allowing different contrast ratios for larger text is useful because   larger text with wider character strokes is easier to read at a lower   contrast.  This allows designers more leeway for contrast of larger   text, which is helpful for content such as titles.  The ratio of   18-point text or 14-point bold text described in the SC 1.4.3 was judged   to be large enough to enable a lower contrast ratio for web pages   displayed on a 15-inch monitor at 1024x768 resolution with a 24-inch   viewing distance.  Mobile device content is viewed on smaller screens   and in different conditions so this allowance for lessened contrast on   large text must be considered carefully for mobile apps.</p>
            <p><em>Note</em>: The use of text that is 1.5 times the default on  mobile platforms does not imply that the text will be readable by a person with  low vision. People with low vision will likely need and use additional platform  level accessibility features and assistive technology such as increased text  size and zoom features to access mobile content. </p>

            </h3>
            <p>Mobile device design has evolved away from built-in physical   keyboards (e.g. fixed, slide-out) towards devices that maximize   touchscreen area and display an on-screen keyboard only when the user   has selected a user interface control that accepts text input (e.g. a   textbox). </p>
            <p>However, keyboard accessibility remains as important as ever and   most major mobile operating systems do include keyboard interfaces,   allowing mobile devices to be operated by external physical keyboards   (e.g. keyboards connected via Bluetooth, USB On-The-Go) or alternative   on-screen keyboards (e.g. scanning on-screen keyboards). </p>
            <p>Supporting these keyboard interfaces benefits several groups with disabilities: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> People with visual disabilities who can benefit from some   characteristics of physical keyboards over touchscreen keyboards (e.g.   clearly separated keys, key nibs and more predictable key layouts). </li>
              <li> People with dexterity or mobility disabilities, who can benefit   from keyboards optimized to minimize inadvertent presses (e.g.   differently shaped, spaced and guarded keys) or from specialized input   methods that emulate keyboard input. </li>
              <li> People who can be confused by the dynamic nature of onscreen   keyboards and who can benefit from the consistency of a physical   keyboard. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Several WCAG 2.0 success criteria are relevant to effective keyboard control: </p>

            <p>The high resolution of mobile devices means that many interactive   elements can be shown together on a small screen. But these elements   must be big enough and have enough distance from each other so that   users can safely target them by touch. </p>
            <p><em>Note:</em> This size is not dependent on the screen size, device or   resolution. Screen magnification should not need to be used to obtain   this size, because magnifying the screen often introduces the need to   pan horizontally as well as vertically, which can decrease usability. </p>

            </h3>
            <p>Many mobile devices are designed to be primarily operated via   gestures made on a touchscreen. These gestures can be simple, such as a   tap with one finger, or very complex, involving multiple fingers,   multiple taps and drawn shapes.</p>
            <p><span class="advisorysuccesscriteria">Gestures in apps should be as easy as possible to carry out. This   is especially important for screen reader interaction modes that replace   direct touch manipulation by a two-step process of focusing and   activating elements. It is also a challenge for users with motor or   dexterity impairments or people who rely on head pointers or a stylus   where multi-touch gestures may be difficult or impossible to perform.   Often, interface designers have different options for how to implement   an action. Widgets requiring complex gestures can be difficult or   impossible to use for screen reader users. </span></p>
            <p>Activating elements via the mouseup or touchend event. Using the   mouseup or touchend event to trigger actions helps prevent unintentional   actions during touch and mouse interaction. Mouse users clicking on   actionable elements (links, buttons, submit inputs) should have the   opportunity to move the cursor outside the element to prevent the event   from being triggered. This allows users to change their minds without   being forced to commit to an action. In the same way, elements accessed   via touch interaction should generally trigger an event (e.g.   navigation, submits) only when the touchend event is fired (i.e. when   all of the following are true:  the user has lifted the finger off the   screen, the last position of the finger is inside the actionable   element, and the last position of the finger equals the position at   touchstart). </p>

            </h3>
            <p>In addition to touchscreen gestures, many mobile operating systems   provide developers with control options that are triggered by physically   manipulating the device (e.g. shaking or tilting). While device   manipulation gestures can help developers create innovative user   interfaces, they can also be a challenge for people who have difficulty   holding or are unable to hold a mobile device. </p>
            <p>Therefore, even when device manipulation gestures are provided,   developers should still provide touch and keyboard operable alternative   control options. </p>

              <p>If a user with low vision has the screen magnified only a small   portion of the page might be viewable at a given time. Placing important   elements before the page scroll allows those who use screen magnifiers   to locate important information without having to scroll the view to   move the magnified area. Placing important elements before the page   scroll also makes it possible to locate content without performing an   interaction. This assists users that have cognitive impairments such as   short-term memory disabilities. Placing important elements before the   page scroll also helps ensure that elements are placed in a consistent   location. Consistent and predictable location of elements assists people   with cognitive impairments and low vision. </p>

            <p>Providing a clear indication that elements are actionable is relevant   for web and native mobile applications that have actionable elements   like buttons or links, especially in interaction modes where actionable elements are commonly detected visually (touch   and mouse use).

            <p>Visual users who interact with content using touch or visual   cursors (e.g. mice, touchpads, joysticks) should be able to clearly   distinguish actionable elements such as links or buttons. Existing   interface design conventions are aimed at  indicating that these visual   elements are actionable. The principle of redundant coding ensures that   elements are indicated as actionable by more than one distinguishing   visual feature. Following these conventions benefits all users, but   especially users with vision impairments. </p>
