<h2 id="usage-notes">Usage notes</h2>
<p>In some countries, like Belgium, it’s uncommon for people to provide a region as part of their postal address. In such cases, the browser returns an empty string as the value of <code>region</code>. However, the address should still be acceptable to use for its intended purpose (e.g., to ship a product). However, always verify addresses to make sure what the user provides is usable.</p>
