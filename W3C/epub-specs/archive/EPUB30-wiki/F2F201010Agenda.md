## Overview ##
This is a working meeting, focused primarily on meeting subgroup deliverables for the first draft release. Each day also has plenary slots for subgroup leads or chairs to propose themes for, before or during the meeting.

### Targets ###

Target outcomes:
  * subgroups: production of implementation proposals
  * full-WG acceptance review of high priority [submitted](ImplementationPipeline.md) implementation proposals
  * subgroups: identify requirements acceptable for postponement beyond 3.0
  * detail plan for draft 1 finalization

### Meeting Groups ###
Subgroup sessions are in the default MO constituted by two groups:

  * Group A: TextContent, Metadata, Annotations, Navigation (Coordinator: Markus)
  * Group B: RichMedia, StylingLayout, EGLS (Coordinator: Brady)

These groups may, depending on the topic at hand, be further divided into smaller subgroups during certain subgroup sessions.

Coordinators are responsible for subgroup session detail planning, and to assure that full-WG plenary slots are populated with topics emerging from the subgroup work.
