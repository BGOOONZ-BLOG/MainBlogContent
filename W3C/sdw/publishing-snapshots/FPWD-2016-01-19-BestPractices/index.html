      <p>This document advises on best practices related to the publication and usage of spatial data on the Web; the use of Web technologies <em>as they may be applied to location</em>. The best practices are intended for practitioners, including Web developers and geospatial experts, and are compiled based on evidence of real-world application. These best practices suggest a significant change of emphasis from traditional Spatial Data Infrastructures by adopting a Linked Data approach. As location is often the common factor across multiple datasets, spatial data is an especially useful addition to the Linked Data cloud; the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 Stars of Linked Data</a> paradigm is promoted where relevant.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">
      <p>As a First Public Working Draft, this document is incomplete. The editors seek to illustrate the full scope of the best practices- albeit with the details missing at this stage. In particular, the <em>examples</em> for each best practice are largely incomplete. The editors intend to compile a much richer set of examples in the period leading up to publication of the next Working Draft. Feedback is requested on the scope of this document and the best practices herein. The editors are particularly keen for reviewers to cite examples that may be used to further illustrate these best practices.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a> for this deliverable states that the best practices will include "<em>an agreed spatial ontology conformant to the ISO 19107 abstract model and based on existing available ontologies [...]</em>". Rather than creating a new spatial ontology, the editors aim to provide a methodology that will help data publishers choose which exisitng spatial ontology is relevant for their application. If deemed necesssary to meet the stated requirements (see [[SDW-UCR]]), a new spatial ontology, or elements that extend the existing spatial ontologies, will be established in subsequent Working Draft releases.</p>
      <p>The editors also intend to provide supplementary methods to navigate through the best practices in order to increase the utility of this document. This will be addressed for the next Working Draft release.</p>
      <p><strong>For OGC</strong>This is a Public Draft of a document prepared by the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDWWG</a>) &mdash; a joint W3C-OGC project (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>). The document is prepared following W3C conventions. The document is released at this time to solicit public comment.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <section id="intro-general">
        <h3>General introduction</h3>
          <p>Data on the Web Best Practices ([[DWBP]]) outlines a growing interest in publishing and consuming data on the Web. Very often the common factor across multiple datasets is the location data. Spatial data, or data related to a location, is what this Best Practice document is all about. </p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="206">Definition of "spatial data" is required.</p>
          <p>It's not that there is a lack of spatial data on the Web; the maps, satellite and street level images offered by search engines are familiar and there are many more nice examples of spatial data being used in Web applications.  However, the data that has been published is difficult to find and often problematic to access for non-specialist users. The key problems we are trying to solve in this document are discoverability and accessibility, and our overarching goal is to bring publishing spatial data into the web mainstream as a mechanism for solving these twin problems.</p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="205">Is "interoperability" also a top-level problem (alongside discoverability and accessibility)?</p>
          <aside class="example"><a href="http://sfpark.org/">SFpark</a> is a Web site where users can look at a map of San Francisco to see where parking is available and at what price. Parking prices are incrementally raised or lowered in SFpark pilot areas based on demand. In this application, static data on existing parking spaces is combined with changing data about where people park the most, which is measured by parking sensors. </aside>
          <p>Different groups of people have a need for spatial data on the Web. </p>
          <p><em><a>Commercial operator</a>s, including search engine operators</em>, invest a great deal of time and effort in generating geographical databases which are mirrors to Web content with the geographical context often added manually or at best semi-automatically. This process would be much better if data were published on the Web with the appropriate geographic information at the source, so it can be found and accessed using the standard mechanisms of the Web.</p>
          <p><em><a>Geospatial expert</a>s</em> who try to find and use data published in <a>Spatial Data Infrastructures</a> (SDI), can get frustrated by the fact that most web services available for spatial data are in fact Web Map Services (<a>WMS</a>) services, which serve static pictures, not data. Web Feature Services (<a>WFS</a>) services, which allow you to get data, also exist, but are far less common. One could ask: do we really have a <a>Spatial Data Infrastructure</a> or is it mostly just a 'spatial picture infrastructure'? </p>
          <p class="note">If you're not a geospatial expert, this may be the first time you've heard terms like <a>SDI</a>, <a>WMS</a> and <a>WFS</a>. But in fact, there is a whole world of geospatial standards, maintained by the Open Geospatial Consortium (<abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>), aimed at publishing geospatial data in a related series of standardized Web services and processing it with specialized tools. These technologies have a steep learning curve.</p>
          <p>The intended users of the <a>SDI</a> are experts in the geospatial domain. The <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> standards cover the full range of geospatial use cases – some of which are very complex. Because of this, it requires significant expertise in geospatial information technology to be able to use the <a>SDI</a>.</p>
          <p>For <em><a>Web developer</a>s</em>, who come from outside the geospatial domain, the data behind the OGC services is part of the "Deep Web" - the data is published behind specialized Web services and is not easy to get at, unless you're an expert. But Web developers are increasingly creating and using data related to locations, e.g. obtained from GPS enabled mobile devices and sensors, so they are important participants in the business of geospatial data.</p>
          <p>The <em><a>public sector</a></em> creates a lot of geospatial data, much of which is open and can be useful to others who may or may not be geospatial data experts. This includes statistical data, for example regions identified by NUTS codes used as territorial units for statistics by the European Union.</p> 
          <p>Spatial data often has a temporal component; things move, and boundaries change over time. Geospatial data is becoming more and more important for the Web and its importance is still growing, among other things because of the rise of the <a>Internet of Things</a>. The importance of spatial data is far beyond serving static 'pixels'. Meaningful information about objects is required with clearly expressed semantics. </p>
          <p>In short, there is a large demand for spatial data on the Web. But there are some questions around publishing spatial data on the Web that keep popping up and need to be answered. One is that many relevant standards already exist. These include informal 'community standards' - geospatial formats and/or vocabularies that enjoy widespread adoption ([[GeoJSON]] being a prime example) - and others for which the formal standardization process has not been completed. Where standards have been completed there are competing ideas, and it is often unclear which one you should use. With these factors in mind, this Best Practice  document aims to clarify and formalize the relevant standards landscape.</p>
          <p>Analysis of the requirements derived from scenarios that describe how spatial data is commonly published and used on the Web (as documented in [[SDW-UCR]]) indicates that, in contrast to the workings of a typical <a>SDI</a>, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data">Linked Data</a> approach is most appropriate for publishing and using spatial data on the Web. Linked Data provides a foundation to many of the best practices in this document.</p>
          <p class="note">If you are not a Web developer, Linked Data may be one of those buzz words that doesn’t mean much to you. Essentially it is about publishing bite size information resources about real world or conceptual things, using URIs to identify those things, and publishing well described relationships between them, all in a machine readable way that enables data from different sources to be connected and queried.</p>

          <p>Questions answered in this document include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How spatial information can best be integrated with other data on the Web;</li>
            <li>How machines and people can discover that different facts in different datasets relate to the same place, especially when 'place' is expressed in different ways and at different levels of granularity;</li>
            <li>How spatial aspects of metadata can be provided;</li>
            <li>How to express temporal properties; and</li>
            <li>How to publish data from sensors and observations with sufficient context to unambiguously interpret the spatial component.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The best practices in this document are based on what is already there. It is not meant to be a 'best theories' document: it takes its examples and solutions from what is being done in practice right now. The examples point to publicly available real-world datasets. In other words, this document is as much as possible evidence based. And where real-world practice is missing, it provides clearly identified <em>recommended practices</em>.</p>
          <p>The best practices in this document are designed to be testable by humans and/or machines in order to determine whether you are following them or not. They are based on the idea of using the Web as a data sharing platform, as described in Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One [[webarch]]. </p>
          <p>This document complies as much as possible with the principles of the  Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] and the (developing) Data on the Web Best Practices [[DWBP]]. Where it does not, this will be identified and explained.</p>

    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document extends the scope of the [[DWBP]] to advise on best practices related to the publication and usage of spatial data on the Web, including sensor data and spatial data. Spatial data concerns resources that have physical extent, from buildings and landmarks to cells on a microscope slide. Where [[DWBP]] is largely concerned with datasets and their distributions (as defined in [[vocab-dcat]]), this document focuses on the content of the spatial datasets: how to describe and relate the individual resources and entities (e.g. <a>SpatialThings</a>) themselves. The best practices included in this document are intended for practitioners; encouraging publication and/or re-use of spatial data (datasets and data streams) on the Web.</p>
      <p>Best practices described in this document fulfill the requirements derived from scenarios that describe how spatial data is commonly published and used on the Web (use cases and requirements are documented in [[SDW-UCR]]). In line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a>, this document provides advice on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The choice of ontology and data format to be used when encoding spatial data (<a href="#bp-expressing-spatial" class="sectionRef"></a>.</li>
        <li>The use of URIs for identifiers of resources described in spatial data (<a href="#bp-identifiers" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
        <li>The use of metadata to complement spatial data (<a href="#bp-expressing-spatial" class="sectionRef"></a> and <a href="#bp-discovery" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
        <li>The use of APIs to expose spatial data (<a href="#bp-exposing-via-api" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Location is often the common factor across multiple datasets, which makes spatial data an especially useful addition to the Linked Data cloud. Departing from the typical approach used in <a>Spatial Data Infrastructures</a>, these best practices promote a <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data">Linked Data</a> approach (<a href="#bp-linking"></a>).

      <p>Given our focus on <em>spatial data</em>, best practices for publishing any kind of data on the Web are deemed to be out of scope. Where relevant to discussion, such best practices will be referenced from other publications including [[DWBP]] and [[LD-BP]]. Other aspects that are out of scope include best practices for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Displaying spatial data on maps;</li>
        <li>Governance of URIs - in particular, who has authority to mint new URIs to identify resources;</li>
        <li>Decribing non-spatial aspects of resources; i.e. <em>thematic semantics</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Compliance with each best practice in this document can be tested by programmatically and/or by human inspection. However, note that determining whether a best practice has been followed or not should be judged based on the intended outcome rather than the possible approach to implementation which is offered as guidance; implementation approaches are subject to change as technology and practices evolve and enhance.</p>

        <h3>Assigning identifiers to real world things and information resources</h3>
        <p>In the geospatial community, the entities within datasets are usually information resources, representing areas on a map, which in turn represent real world things. These information resources are usually called 'features'. A feature is a representation of a real world thing and there could be, and often are, more than one feature representing the same real world thing. A feature often has, as a property, a geometry which describes the location of the feature.</p>
        <p>For example, a lighthouse standing somewhere on the coast is a real world thing. In some dataset, an information record about this lighthouse exists: a 'feature'. In current practice, this feature will often have properties that are about the real thing (e.g. the height of the lighthouse) and properties about the information record (e.g. when it was last modified). There could be several features, in different datasets, that refer to the same lighthouse; one dataset has its location and date it was built, another has data about its ownership or about shipwrecks near the same lighthouse.</p>
        <p>Mostly, people looking for information are interested in real world things, not in information resources. This means the real world things should get global identifiers so they can be found and referenced. The features and their map representations - geometries and topologies - should have global identifiers too so they can be referenced as well; and must have them if they are managed elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="208">Discussion on Features, information resources and real-world Things is unclear and needs redrafting</p>
        <div class="practice">
          <p><span id="globally-unique-ids" class="practicelab">Use globally unique HTTP identifiers for entity-level resources</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">Entities within datasets SHOULD have unique, persistent HTTP or HTTP(S) URIs as identifiers.</p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="191">The term "entity-level resources" is confusing and needs to be clarified or replaced.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>A lot of spatial data is available 'via the Web' - but not really 'on the web': you can download datasets, or view, query and download data via web services, but it is usually not possible to reference an entity within a dataset, like you would a web page. If this were possible, spatial data would be much easier to reuse and to integrate with other data on the Web.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Entities (<a>SpatialThings</a>) described in a dataset will each be identified using a globally unique HTTP URI so that a given entity can be unambiguously identified in statements that refer to that entity.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>In order for identifiers to be useful, people should be comfortable creating them themselves without needing to refer to some top-level naming authority- much like how Twitter's hashtags are created dynamically. Good identifiers for data on the web should be dereferenceable/resolvable, which makes it a good idea to use HTTP URIs as identifiers. There is no top down authority that you have to go to in order to create such identifiers for spatial objects. So just make them up yourself if you need them and they don't exist. <a href="#reuse-ids">Best Practice 2: Reuse existing (authoritative) identifiers when available</a> explains how to find already existing identifiers you can reuse.</p>
            <p>Read [[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 11: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> for general discussion on why persistent URIs should be used as identifiers for data entities. Using URIs means the data can be referenced using standard Web mechanisms; making them persistent means the links won't get broken. Note that ideally the URIs should resolve, however, they have value as globally scoped variables whether they resolve or not.</p>
            <p>For guidance about how to create persistent URIs, read [[DWBP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers</a>. Keep in mind not to use service endpoint URLs, as these are usually dependent on technology, implementation, and/or API version and will probably change when the implementation changes.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>In general, re-using identifiers for well-known resources is a good idea, because it discourages proliferation of disparate copies with uncertain provenance. Linking your own resources to well-known or authoritative resources also makes relationships between your data and other data, which refers to the same well-known resource, discoverable. The result is a network of related resources using the identifiers for the <a>SpatialThings</a>.</p>
            <p>In the case of <a>SpatialThings</a>, a simple way of indicating a location is by referencing an already existing named place resource on the Web. For example, DBpedia and GeoNames are existing datasets with well-known spatial resources, i.e. besides place names and a lot of other information, a set of coordinates is also available for the resources in these datasets. The advantage of referring to these named place resources is that it makes clear that different resources which refer to, for example, <code>http://dbpedia.org/page/Utrecht</code>, are all referring to the same city. If these resources did not use a URI reference but a literal value "Utrecht" this could mean the province Utrecht, the city Utrecht (both places in the Netherlands), the South African town called Utrecht, or maybe something else entirely. </p>

            <p>DBpedia and GeoNames are examples of popular, community-driven resource collections.

<!--          <p class="issue" data-number="191">The term "entity-level resources" is confusing and needs to be clarified or replaced.</p> -->
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>There are many mechanisms to reconcile (i.e. find related, map or link) objects from different datasets. When two spatial datasets contain geometries, you can use spatial functions to find out which objects overlap, touch, etc. Based on this spatial correlation you might determine that two datasets are talking about the same places, but this is often not enough. For reasons of efficiency or simply for being able to use these spatial correlations in a context where spatial functions are not available, it is a good idea to express these spatial relationships explicitly in your data. There is also danger in relying on spatial correlation alone; you might conclude that two resources represent the same thing when in reality they represent, for example, a shop at ground level and living apartment above it.</p>

          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>If you want to link two spatial datasets, find out if they have corresponding geometries using spatial functions and then express these correspondences as explicit relationships.</p>
            <p>In this best practice we only give guidance on spatial reconciliation (e.g. two mentions of Paris are talking about the same place). We do not address thematic reconciliation.</p>
            <p>If the spatial datasets you want to reconcile are managed in a Geographic Information System (<a>GIS</a>), you can use the GIS spatial functions to find related spatial things. If your spatial things are expressed as Linked Data, you can use [[GeoSPARQL]], which has a set of spatial query functions available. </p>
            <p>How to express discovered relationships is discussed in <a href="#semantic-rels">Best Practice 13: Assert known relationships</a>. </p>

        <h3>Expressing spatial data</h3>
        <p>It is important to publish your spatial data with clear semantics. The primary use case for this is you already have a database of assets and you want to publish the semantics of this data. Another use case is someone wanting to publish some information which has a spatial component on the web in a form that search engines will understand. </p>
        <p>The spatial thing itself as well as its spatial properties have semantics. There are several vocabularies which cover spatial things and spatial properties. If you need extra semantics not available in an existing vocabulary, you should create your own. </p>
        <p>How to publish your vocabulary, which describes the meaning of your data, is explained in [[LD-BP]]. We recommend that you link your own vocabulary to commonly used existing ones because this increases its usefulness. How to do this is out of scope for this document; however, we give some examples of mapping relations you can use from OWL, SKOS, RDFS. And we do the mapping between some commonly used spatial vocabularies. </p>

                <ul>

These could be toponyms (names that appear on a map) or colloquial names (that local people use for a place). This part will explain in more detail how to provide the names/labels for the spatial things that are referred to. (e.g. a way to do this could be rdfs:label)</li>
                    <li>A 'place' may have an indistinct (or even undefined) boundary. It is often useful to identify spatial things even though they are fuzzy. For example: 'Renaissance Italy' or 'the American West'.</li>
                    <li>Information (about a <a>SpatialThing</a>; a place) should be provided with information about authority (owner, publisher), timeliness (i.e. is it valid now? is it historical data?) and, (if applicable) quality. It is common, for example, that there exist many maps of a place - none of them the same. In that case users need to know who produced each one, to be able to choose the right one to use.</li>

                <p>Steps to follow: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decide on the geometric data representations based on performance; in some cases, geometry can be 95% of the total data size;</li>
                    <li>Determine the dimensionality of geometry data (0d 'point' to 3d 'volume')</li>
                  <li>Choose the right format and deciding on when to use geometry literals. For geometry literals, several solutions are available, like Well-Known Text (<a>WKT</a>) representations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash">GeoHash</a> and other geocoding representations. The alternative is to use structured geometry objects as is possible, for example, in [[GeoSPARQL]].</li>
                    <li>There are also several suitable binary data formats (e.g. <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Google's protocol buffers</a> for vector tiling); however, some binary formats do not (effectively) work on the Web as there are no software tools for working with those formats from within a typical Web application; to work with data in such formats, you must first download the data and then work with it locally. </li>
                    <li>There are widespread practices for representing geometric data as linked data, such as using W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#">WGS84 Geo Positioning vocabulary</a> (geo) <code>geo:lat</code> and <code>geo:long</code> that are used extensively for describing <code>geo:Point</code> objects.</li>
                    <li>Concrete geometry types are available, such as those defined in the OpenGIS [[Simple-Features]] Specification, namely 0-dimensional Point and MultiPoint; 1-dimensional curve LineString and MultiLineString; 2-dimensional surface Polygon and MultiPolygon; and the heterogeneous GeometryCollection. </li>

              <p>The choice of <a>CRS</a> is sensitive to the intended domain of application for the geospatial data. For the majority of applications a common global CRS (WGS84) is fine, but high precision applications (such as precision agriculture and defence) require spatial referencing to be accurate to a few meters or even centimeters.</p>

              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>Recommendations about CRS referencing should consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a default Coordinate Reference System is sufficient.</li>
                    <li>The choice of CRS should be sensitive to the intended domain of application for the geospatial data.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS84</a> is a common choice of CRS - although this in itself is ambiguous: we need to assert whether data relates to the ellipsoid (datum surface) or the geoid (gravitational equipotential surface; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGM96">EGM96</a>).</li>
                    <li>WGS84 is a reasonable choice for many human-scale activities (e.g. navigation). However, given that the earth's surface is constantly moving (e.g. Australia moves by 7cm per year), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS84</a> is not appropriate for precision applications. For example, the defense community uses 12 separate Mercator projections to maintain accuracy around the globe whilst the Australian national mapping authority is considering use of a dynamic datum [<span style="background-color:yellow">citation required</span>].</li>
                    <li>For convenience, the CRS is often designated within the data format or vocabulary specification (e.g. <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos">W3C WGS84 Geo Positioning vocabulary</a>) and, therefore, does not appear in the data itself. This is often considered as a default CRS. Data publishers and consumers should make sure they are aware of the specified CRS and any limitations that this may pose regarding the use of the data.</li>
                    <li>Where a specific CRS is required, the data publisher should choose a vocabulary where the CRS can be defined explicitly within the data.</li>

              <p>Entities and their properties can change over time and this change can be related to spatial properties, for example when a spatial thing moves from one location to another location, or when it becomes bigger or smaller. For some use cases you need to be able to explicitly refer to a particular version of information that describes a <a>SpatialThing</a>, or to infer which geometry is appropriate at a specific time, based on the versioning. To make this possible, the properties that are described for an entity should have references to the time and location that the information describing a <a>SpatialThing</a> was captured and should retain a version history. This allows you to reference the most recent data as well as previous versions and to also follow the changes of the properties. </p>

              <p>When entities and their properties can change over time, or are valid only at a given time, and this needs to be captured, it is important to specify a clear relationship between property data and its versioning information. How properties are versioned should be explained in the specification or schema that defines those properties. Temporal and/or spatial metadata should be provided to indicate when and where the information about the <a>SpatialThing</a> was captured. </p>
              <p>For an example of how to version information about entities and their properties and retaining a version history, see <code>version:VersionedThing</code> and <code>version:Version</code> at <a href="https://github.com/UKGovLD/registry-core/wiki/Principles-and-concepts#versioned-types">https://github.com/UKGovLD/registry-core/wiki/Principles-and-concepts#versioned-types</a>.</p>
              <p>It is also useful to incorporate information on how often the information might change, i.e. the frequency of update.</p>
              <p>Data publishers must decide how much change is acceptable before a <a>SpatialThing</a> cannot be considered equivalent.

          <h4>Publishing data with clear semantics</h4>
          <p>In most cases, the effective use of information resources requires understanding thematic concepts in addition to the spatial ones; "spatial" is just a facet of the broader information space. For example, when the <a href="http://www.brandweer.nl/amsterdam-amstelland">Dutch Fire Service</a> responded to an incident at a day care center, they needed to evacuate the children. In this case, the <em>2nd</em> closest alternative day care center was preferred because it was operated by the same organization as the one that was subject of the incident, and they knew who all the children were.</p>
          <p>This best practice document provides mechanisms for determining how places and locations are related - but determining the compatibility or validity of thematic data elements is beyond our scope; we're not attempting to solve the problem of different views on the same/similar resources.</p>

              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>There are various vocabularies that provide common information (semantics) about spatial things, such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/">
                Basic Geo vocabulary</a>, [[GeoSPARQL]] or <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> that provide common information about spatial things. This best practice helps you decide which vocabulary to use. The semantic description of entities and their properties should use the existing common vocabularies in their descriptions to increase the interoperability with other descriptions that may refer to the same vocabularies.  For this it is required to: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Go through a selection process to decide on the existing and relevant vocabularies that can be used to describe the spatial things and their properties. </li>
                  <li>Maintain links to the vocabularies in the schema definitions and provide linked-data descriptions.</li>
                  <li>Define location and spatial references using the common vocabulary concepts whenever applicable instead of defining your own location instance. </li>
                  <li>Provide thematic semantics and general descriptions of spatial things and their properties as linked data. They should have URIs in which when you look those up you can see what they mean. For more information refer to [[DWBP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#StructuralMetadata">Best Practice 4: Provide structural metadata</a>.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>There are different vocabularies that are related to spatial things. This best practice will provide a method for selecting the right vocabulary for your task, in the form of a durable methodology or an actionable selection list.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/">Basic Geo vocabulary</a> has a class <a>SpatialThing</a> which has a very broad definition. This can be applicable (as a generic concept) to most of the common use-cases.</p>

            <p class="practicedesc">Spatial relationships between Things should be specified in forms of geographical, topological and hierarchical links.</p>
            <section class="axioms">
              <p class="subhead">Why</p>
              <p>It is often more efficient to rely on relationships asserted between SpatialThings rather than rely on solutions such as analysis of geometries to find out that two Things are, for example, at the same place, near each other, or one is inside the other. Describing the spatial relationships between SpatialThings can be based on relationships such as topological,  geographical and hierarchical (e.g. partOf) links.</p>
              <p>Relating SpatialThings to other spatial data enables, for example, digital personal assistants (e.g. Siri, Cortana) to make helpful suggestions or infer useful information  such as "address" and "description" attributes added to extent data model of GeoLocation API. See also <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/emma/">W3C EMMA 2.0</a>; devices provide location and time-stamp data, and this helps us, for example:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Determining whether 'this' device interaction was 'within' a car, rather than the device being carried by a pedestrian, may result in different outcomes or suggestions</li>
                <li>Determining whether an event for a traveler took place after the journey started and before it ended … we can infer the event was on-route</li>
                <li>'near' is contextual - it depends if you're walking or driving</li>
                <li>Capturing social information; "I'm on my way to work" rather than "I'm here" … where work is a SpatialThing with indistinct boundaries</li>

            <section class="outcome">
              <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
              <p>This requirement will allow expressing explicit spatial relationships between Things in the form of geographical, topological and hierarchical links that will not need post geometric processing and inferring to find the spatial links.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="how">
              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>How to use spatial functions to find out if spatial things have corresponding geometries is described in <a href="#lacking-ids">Best Practice 3: Working with data that lacks globally unique identifiers for entity-level resources</a>. This best practice describes how to express these discovered relationships between resources about physical and conceptual spatial things.</p>
              <p>The asserted spatial semantics can include relationship such as nearby, contains, etc. This best practice requires specifying geometric, topological and social spatial relationships. It is also important to determine which relationships are appropriate for a given case (This is beyond the scope of this BP).  This best practice requires:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The geographical, topological and social hierarchy (part of) should be described with clear semantics and registered with IANA <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">Link relations</a>.</li>
                  <li>Hierarchical relationships (i.e. part of, for example between administrative regions, have a specific need for defining "Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive" (MECE) set.</li>
                  <li>Topological relationships that are described for an entity should have references to concepts such as over, under etc.</li>
                  <li>Spatial relationships can use concepts such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus">Region Connection Calculus</a> (RCC8) that contains, overlaps, touches, intersects, adjacent to, or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM#Spatial_predicates">spatial predicates</a>" or also other similar concepts from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_interval_algebra">Allen Calculus</a>.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>Social relationships can be defined based on perception; e.g. "samePlaceAs", nearby, south of. These relationships can also be defined based on temporal concepts such as: after, around, etc. In current practice, there is no such property as <code>samePlaceAs</code> to express the social notion of <em>place</em>; enabling communities to unambiguously indicate that they are referring to the same place but without getting hung up on the semantic complexities inherent in the use of <code>owl:sameAs</code> or similar.</p>

        <h3>Linking spatial data</h3>

        <p>For data to be <em>on the web</em> the resources it describes need to be connected, or <em>linked</em>, to other resources. The <em>connectedness</em> of data is one of the fundamentals of the Linked Data approach that these best practices build upon. The <a href="http://5stardata.info">5-star rating for Linked Open Data</a> asserts that to achieve the fifth star you must "link your data to other data to provide context". The benefits for consumers and publishers of linking to other data are <a href="http://5stardata.info/en/#addendum5">listed</a> as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You can discover more (related) data while consuming the data.</li>
          <li>You can directly learn about the data schema.</li>
          <li>You make your data discoverable.</li>
          <li>You increase the value of your data.</li>
          <li>Your own organization will gain the same benefits from the links as the [other] consumers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Just like any type of data, spatial data benefits massively from linking when publishing on the web.</p>

        <p class="note">The widespread use of links within data is regarded as one of the most significant departures from contemporary practices used within SDIs.</p>

        <p>Crucially, the use of links is predicated on the ability to identify the origin and target, or <em>beginning</em> and <em>end</em>, of the link. <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique identifiers for entity-level resources</a> is a prerequisite.</p>

        <p>This section extends [[DWBP]] by providing best practices that are concerned with <em>creating</em> links between the resources described inside datasets. Best practices detailing the use of links to support discovery are provided in <a href="#bp-discovery" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>[[DWBP]] identifies <em>Linkability</em> as one of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#bp-benefits">benefits</a> gained from implementing the Data on the Web best practices (see [[DWBP]] <a href="/TR/dwbp/#DataIdentifiers">Data Identification</a> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 11 Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 12 Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a>). However, no discussion is provided about how to create the links that the use those persistent URIs.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Exposing entity-level links to web applications, user-agents and web crawlers allows the relationships between resources to be found without the data user needing to download the entire dataset for local analysis. Entity-level links provide explicit description of the relationships between resources and enable users to find related data and determine whether the related data is worth accessing. Entity-level links can be used to combine information from different sources; for example, to determine correlations in statistical data relating to the same location.</p>

            <p class="note">[[gml]] adopted the [[xlink11]] standard to represent links between resources. At the time of adoption, XLink was the only W3C-endorsed standard mechanism for describing links between resources within XML documents. The <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> anticipated broad adoption of XLink over time - and, with that adoption, provision of support within software tooling. While XML Schema, XPath, XSLT and XQuery etc. have seen good software support over the years, this never happened with XLink. The authors of GML note that given the lack of widespread support, use of Xlink within GML provided no significant advantage over and above use a bespoke mechanism tailored to the needs of GML.</p>

            <p>Links enable a network of related resources to be connected together.

Typically, it is the <a>SpatialThings</a> that are given durable identifiers (see <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique identifiers for entity-level resources</a>) whereas the information resources that describe them (e.g. geometry objects) may be replaced by new versions.</p>

              <p>This best practice is concerned with the connections <em>between</em> <a>SpatialThings</a>. When describing an individual <a>SpatialThing</a> itself, it is often desirable to decompose the information into several uniquely identified objects. For example, the geometry of an administrative area may be managed as a separate resource due to the large number of geometric points required to describe the boundary.</p>
              <p>Also note that in many cases, different identifiers are used to describe the <a>SpatialThing</a> and the information resource that describes that <a>SpatialThing</a>. For example, within <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, the city of Sapporo, Japan, is identified as <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>resource</u>/Sapporo</code>, while the information resource that describes this resource is identified as <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>page</u>/Sapporo</code>. Care should be taken to select the identifier for the <a>SpatialThing</a> rather than the information resource that describes it; in the example above, this is <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>resource</u>/Sapporo</code>.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>In Linked Data, commonly used resources behave like hubs in the network of interlinked resources. By linking your spatial resources to those in common usage it will be easier to discover your resources. For example, a data user interested in air quality data about the place they live might begin by searching for that place in popular data repositories such as <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a>, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> or <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>. Once the user finds the resource that describes the correct place, they can search for data that refers to the identified resource that, in this case, relates to air quality.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, by referring to resources in common usage, it becomes even easier to find those resources as search engines will prioritize resources that are linked to more often.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Relationships between resources with with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape, or position; <a>SpatialThings</a>) can often inferred from their spatial properties. For example, two resources might occur at the same location suggesting that they may be the same resource, or one resource might exist entirely within the bounds of another resource suggesting some kind of hierarchical containment relationship. However, reconciliation of such resources is complex: it requires some degree of understanding about the semantics of the two, potentially related, resources in order to determine how they are related, if at all.</p>
            <p>Rather than expecting that data consumers will have sufficient context to relate resources, it is better for data publishers to assert the relationships that they know about. Not only does this provide data users with clear information about how resources are related, it removes the need for complex spatial processing (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus">region connection calculus</a>) to determine potential relationships between resources with spatial extent because those relations are already made explicit.</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Where possible, existing identifiers should be reused when referring to resources (see <a href="http://w3c.github.io/sdw/bp/#reuse-ids">Best Practice 2: Reuse existing (authoritative) identifiers when available</a>). However, the use of multiple identifiers for the same resource is commonplace, for example, where data publishers from different jurisdictions refer to the same <a>SpatialThing</a>. In this special case, properties such as <code>owl:sameAs</code> can be used to declare that multiple identifiers refer to the same resource. It is often the case that data published from different sources about the same physical or conceptual resource may provide different view points.</p>

        <h3>Enabling discovery</h3>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing the provision of metadata to support discovery of data at the <em>dataset</em> level (see [[DWBP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#metadata">section 9.2 Metadata</a> for more details). This mode of discovery is well aligned with the practices used in <a>Spatial Data Infrastructure</a> (SDI) where a user begins their search for spatial data by submitting a query to a catalog. Once the appropriate dataset has been located, the information provided by the catalog enables the user to find a service end-point from which to access the data itself - which may be as simple as providing a mechanism to download the entire dataset for local usage or may provide a rich API enabling the users to request only the required parts for their needs. The dataset-level metadata is used by the catalog to match the appropriate dataset(s) with the user's query.</p>
        <p>This section includes a best practice for including spatial information in the dataset metadata, for example, the spatial extent of the dataset.</p>
        <p>However, one of the criteria for exposing data <em>on the Web</em> is that it can be discovered directly using search engines such as <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> and <a href="https://www.yandex.com/">Yandex</a>. Current <a>SDI</a> approaches treat spatial data much like books in a library where you must first use the librarian's card catalog index to find the book on the shelf. As for other types of data on the Web, we want to be able to find spatial resources directly; we want to move beyond the two-step discovery approach of contemporary <a>SDIs</a> and find the words, sentences and chapters in a book without needing to check the card catalog first. Not only will this make spatial data far more accessible, it mitigates the problems caused when catalogs have only stale dataset metadata and removes the need for data users to be proficient with the query protocol of the dataset's service end-point in order to acquire the data they need.</p>
        <p>In the wider Web, it is links that enable this direct discovery: from user-agents following a hyperlink to find related information to search engines using links to prioritise and refine search results. Whereas <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a> discusses the <em>creation</em> of links, this section is largely concerned with the <em>use</em> of those links to support discovery of the <a>SpatialThings</a> described in spatial datasets.</p>

        <div class="practice">
          <p><span id="find-related-data" class="practicelab">Use links to find related data</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">Related data to a spatial dataset and its individual data items should be discoverable by browsing the links</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>In much the same way as the <em>document Web</em> allows one to find related content by following hyperlinks, the links between spatial datasets, <a>SpatialThings</a> described in those datasets and other resources on the Web enable humans and software agents to explore rich and diverse content without the need to download a collection of datasets for local processing in order to determine the relationships between resources.</p>
            <p>Spatial data is typically well structured; datasets contain <a>SpatialThings</a> that can be uniquely identified. This means that spatial data is well suited to the use of links to find related content.</p>
            <p class="note">The emergency response to natural disasters is often delayed by the need to download and correlate spatial datasets before effective planning can begin. Not only is the initial response hampered, but often the correlations between resources in datasets are discarded once the emergency response is complete because participants have not been able to capture and republish those correlations for subsequent usage.</p>

            <p>It should be possible for humans to explore the links between a spatial dataset (or its individual items) and other related data on the Web. </p> 
            <p>It should be possible for software agents to automatically discover related data by exploring the links between a spatial dataset (or its individual items) and other resources on the Web.</p>
            <p>It should be possible for a human or software agent to determine which links are relevant to them and which links can be considered trustworthy.</p>

            <p class="issue" data-number="66">What do we expect user-agents to do with a multitude of links from a single resource? A document hyperlink has just one target; but in data, a resource may be related to many things.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>For a given subject resource find all the related resources that it refers to.</li>
              <li>Evaluate the property type that is used to relate each resource in order to determine relevance (see <a href="http://w3c.github.io/sdw/bp/#meaningful-links">Best Practice 20: Provide meaningful links</a>).</li>
              <li>Use the metadata for the dataset within which the subject resource is described in order to determine which links to "trust" (e.g. whether to use the data or not); owner / publisher, quality information, community annotations (“likes”), publication date etc.</li>
              <li>Aggregate links from trusted sources into a database. Referring URLs can be indexed to determine which resources <em>refer to</em> the subject resource, i.e. "what points to me?". These referring links are sometimes called <em>back-links</em>. Dataset-level metadata may provide information regarding the frequency of update for the information sources, enabling one to determine a mechanism for keeping the aggregated link-set fresh.
                <div class="note">
                  <p>These "back-links" can be traversed to find related information and also help a publisher assess the value of their content by making it possible to see who is using (or referencing) their data.</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>Use network / graph analysis algorithms to determine related information that is not directly connected; i.e. resources that are connected via a chain of links and intermediate resources.</li>

        <h3>Exposing datasets through Web services</h3>
        <p class="issue" data-number="187">Should content from this section be moved to [[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#dataAccess">section 9.11 Data Access</a>?</p>

        <p><a>SDIs</a> have long been used to provide access to spatial data via web services; typically using open standard specifications from the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC). With the exception of the <a>Web Map Service</a>, these OGC Web service specifications have not seen widespread adoption beyond the geospatial expert community. In parallel, we have seen widespread emergence of Web applications that use spatial data - albeit focusing largely on point-based data.</p>
        <p>This section seeks to capture the best practices that have emerged from the wider Web community for accessing spatial data via the Web. While [[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing access to data using Web infrastructure (see [[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#dataAccess">section 9.11 Data Access</a>), this section provides additional insight for publishers of spatial data. In particular, we look at how <em>Application Program Interfaces</em> (API) may be used to make it easy to work with spatial data.</p>

        <p class="note">The term API as used here refers to the combination of the <i>set of operations</i> provided and the <i>data content</i> exposed by a particular Web service end-point.</p>

          <p class="practicedesc">Granularity of mechanisms provided to access access a dataset should be decided based on available resources</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Making data available on the Web requires data publishers to provide some form of access to the data. There are numerous mechanisms available, each providing varying levels of utility and incurring differing levels of effort and cost to implement and maintain. Publishers of spatial data should make their data available on the Web using affordable mechanisms in order to ensure long-term, sustainable access to their data.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Data is published on the Web in a mechanism that the data publisher can afford to implement and support throughout the anticipated lifetime of the data.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>When determining the mechanism to be used provide Web access to data, publishers need to assess utility against cost. In order of increasing usefulness and cost:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Bulk-download or streaming of the entire dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#BulkAccess">Best Practice 20: Provide bulk download</a>)</li>
              <li>Generalized query API (such as <a>WFS</a> or SPARQL [[sparql11-overview]])</li>
              <li>Bespoke API designed to support a particular application (see <a href="#convenience-apis">Best Practice 28: Expose entity-level data through 'convenience APIs'</a>)</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note">[[DWBP]] indicates that when data that is logically organized as one container and is distributed across many URLs, accessing the data in bulk is useful. As a minimum, it should be possible for users to download data on the Web as a single resource; e.g. through bulk file formats.</p>

            <p class="note">A data publisher need not incur all the costs alone. Given motivation, third parties (such as the open data community or commercial providers) may provide value-added services that build on simple bulk-download or generalized query interfaces. While establishing such arrangements is beyond the scope of this document, it is important to note that the data publisher should consider the end-to-end data publication chain. For example, one may need to consider including conditions in the usage license about the timeliness of frequently changing data.</p>

          <p class="practicedesc">If you have a specific application in mind for publishing your data, tailor the spatial data API to meet that goal.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>When access to spatial data is provided by bulk download or through a generalized query service, users need to understand how the data is structured in order to work effectively with that data. Given that spatial data may be arbitrarily complex, this burdens the data user with significant effort before they can even perform simple queries. <strong>Convenience APIs</strong> are tailored to meet a specific goal; enabling a user to engage with arbitrarily complex data structures using (a set of) simple queries. As stated in [[DWBP]], an API offers the greatest flexibility and processability for consumers of data; for example, enabling real-time data usage, filtering on request, and the ability to work with the data at an atomic level. If your dataset is large, frequently updated, or highly complex, a convenience API is likely to be helpful.</p>

              <li>Data users are presented with a set of simple operations within the API that enable them to get working with the data quickly; they do not need to understand the structure and semantics of the data up front.</li>

              <li>The API provides both machine readable data and human readable HTML markup; the latter is used by search engines to index the spatial data.</li>
              <li>The API encapsulates (i.e. hides) the complexity of the data is exposes.</li>

            <p class="note">This best practice extends [[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#useanAPI">Best Practice 26: Use an API</a>.</p>

            <p>The API should be targeted to deliver a coherent set of functions that are design to meet the needs of common tasks. Work with your developer community to determine the tasks that they want to do with the data or use your experience to infer those tasks. Design your API to help developers achieve those tasks. API operations may be one of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>query and response - for requesting data</li>
              <li>publish and subscribe - for disseminating real-time or event-based data</li>
              <li>transaction - for storing, modifying, processing or analysing data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Include light-weight queries and/or operations in the API that help users start working with your data quickly. The complexity of the data should be hidden from inexperienced users.</p>
            <p>The API should offer <em>both</em> machine readable data and human readable HTML that includes the structured metadata required by search engines seeking to index content (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines">Best Practice 25: Make your entity-level data indexable by search engines</a> for more details).</p>
            <p>When designing the API, each operation or query should be focused on achieving a single outcome; this should ensure that the API remains light-weight. Groups of API operations may be chained together (like unix pipes) in order to complete complex tasks.</p>
            <p>When designing APIs, data publishers must be aware of the constraints of operating in a Web environment. Providing access to large datasets, such as <a>coverages</a>, is a particular challenge. The API should provide mechanisms to request subsets of the dataset that are a convenient size for client applications to manage.</p>
            <p>APIs will often evolve as more data is added or usage changes; queries or operations may be changed or new ones added. APIs should be versioned in order to insulate downstream client applications from these changes.</p>
            <p class="note">Regarding API design, also see [[DWBP]] <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/bp.html#APIHttpVerbs">Best Practice 21: Use Web Standardized Interfaces</a>.</p>
            <p>In the geospatial domain there are a lot of <a>WFS</a> services providing data. A RESTful API as a wrapper or a shim layer could be created around WFS services. GML content from the WFS service could be provided in this way as linked data or another Web friendly format. This approach is similar to the use of Z39.50 in the library community; that protocol is still used but 'modern' Web sites and web services are wrapped around it. Adding URIs in (GML) data exposed by a WFS is pretty straightforward, but making the data 'webby' is harder. There are examples of this approach of creating a convenience API on top of WFS, but rather than adapting the WFS (GML) output, it may be more effective to provide an alternative 'Linked Data friendly' access path to the data source; creating a new, complementary service endpoint e.g. expose the underpinning postGIS database via SPARQL endpoint (using something like <a href="http://www.melodiesproject.eu/content/ontop-spatial">ontop-spatial</a>) and Linked Data API.</p>

            <p>As a minimum, you should provide a human readable description of your APIs so that developers can read about how the API works.

      <h2>Applicability of common formats to implementation of Best Practices</h2>
      <p>The Spatial Data on the Web working group is working on recommendations about the use of formats for publishing spatial data on the web, specifically about selecting the most appropriate format. There may not be one most appropriate format: which format is best may depend on many things. This section gives two tables that both aim to be helpful in selecting the right format in a given situation. These tables may in future be merged or reworked in other ways. </p>
      <p>The first table is a matrix of the common formats, showing in general terms how well these formats help achieve goals such as discoverability, granularity etc. </p>

      <h2>Authoritative sources of geographic identifiers</h2>
      <p>As per <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html</a> item 4, it's useful for people to link their data to other related data. In this context we're most frequently talking about either Spatial Things and/or their geometry.</p>
      <p> There are many useful sets of identifiers for spatial things and which ones are most useful will depend on context. This involves discovering relevant URIs that you might want to connect to.</p>
      <p>Relevant URIs for spatial things can be found in many places. This list gives the first places you should check:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a></li>
        <li>National open spatial datasets such as are made available by for example the UK and Dutch governments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finding out which national open spatial datasets are available and how they can be accessed, currently requires prior knowledge in most cases, because these datasets are often not easily discoverable. Look for national dataportals / geoportals such as <a href="http://nationaalgeoregister.nl">Nationaal Georegister</a> (Dutch national register of geospatial datasets) or <a href="https://data.overheid.nl">Dataportaal van de Nederlandse overheid</a> (Dutch national governmental data portal). </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>As an example, let's take Edinburgh. In some recent work with the Scottish Government, we have an identifier for the City of Edinburgh Council Area - i.e. the geographical area that Edinburgh City Council is responsible for:</p>
        
        <code>http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</code>
        
        <p>(note that this URI doesn't resolve yet but it will in the next couple of months once the system goes properly live)</p>
        
        <p>The UK government provides an identifier for Edinburgh and/or information about it that we might want to link to:</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036">http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</a></p> 
        
        <p>The Scottish identifier is directly based on this one, but the Scottish Government wanted the ability to create something dereferenceable, potentially with additional or different info to the data.gov.uk one. These two are owl:sameAs.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh"></a></p> 
        <p>DBpedia also includes a resource about Edinburgh. Relationship: "more or less the same as" but probably not the strict semantics of owl:sameAs.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81482">http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81482</a></p>
        <p>This Edinburgh resource is found by querying the OS gazetteer search service for 'Edinburgh' then checking the labels of the results that came up. OS give it a type of 'NamedPlace' and give it some coordinates.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81483">http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/50kGazetteer/81483</a></p> 
        <p>This Edinburgh airport resource was also found by the same OS gazetteer search service for 'Edinburgh'.  This is clearly not the same as the original spatial thing, but you might want to say something like 'within' or 'hasAirport'.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505">http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505</a></p>
        <p>This resource is in the OS 'Boundary Line' service that contains administrative and statistical geography areas in the UK. It's probably safe to say the original identifier is owl:sameAs this one.</p>
        
        <p><a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2650225/">http://sws.geonames.org/2650225/</a></p>
        <p>This is the Geonames resource for Edinburgh found using the search service: <code>http://api.geonames.org/search?name=Edinburgh&amp;type=rdf&amp;username=demo</code>
        Once you have found a place in GeoNames, there are other useful services to find things that are nearby. </p>
