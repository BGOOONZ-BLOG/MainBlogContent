[Thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/34ec738507bfa7f3)

New proposal:

  * no RS requirements to support any format
  * statement that resources in track@src are exempt from epub-imposed fallback

## manifest-level fallbacks ##
[Issue 118](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=118) ([Issue 119](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=119), [Issue 120](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=120))

[Thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/dd5693b9216163b3)

_Proposal summary:_

  * Manifest-level fallbacks are no longer applicable to Publication Resources referenced from within XHTML and SVG documents (or should at least be deprecated)
  * For HTML and SVG elements _that have intrinsic fallback mechanisms_, referencing Foreign (aka non-core-media-type) Resources is still allowed, as long as intrinsic fallback to a Core Media Type resource is provided.
  * For HTML and SVG elements _that do **not** have intrinsic fallback mechanisms_, resources referenced must be Core Media Types directly (as exemplified in [Issue 128](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=128)).
  * Manifest-level fallback is restricted to apply to the Package spine only.
