<p>
  The terminology for dates has evolved over time. While the qualifier “floating” applied to dates
  and times is now preferred, it can also be called “local”. Due to this
  <a href="#concept-datetime-floating">floating date and time</a> is sometimes called
  <dfn id="concept-datetime-local">local date and time</dfn>;

  <a href="#valid-floating-date-and-time-string">valid floating date and time string</a> is sometimes called
  <dfn id="valid-local-date-and-time-string">valid local date and time string</dfn>;

  <a href="#valid-normalised-floating-date-and-time-string">valid normalised floating date and time string</a> is sometimes called
  <dfn id="valid-normalised-local-date-and-time-string">valid normalised local date and time string</dfn>; and

  <a href="#parse-a-floating-date-and-time-string">parse a floating date and time string</a> is sometimes called
  <dfn id="parse-a-local-date-and-time-string">parse a local date and time string</dfn>.
