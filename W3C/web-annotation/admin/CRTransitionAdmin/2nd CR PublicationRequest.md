[to be sent to the webmaster, comm team, coralie, xueyuan, WG chairs and editors, Doug, on the 25th of July 2016]

Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of three Web Annotation WG documents as Candidate Recommendations. The publication date is the 6th of September, 2016.

This is a second publication of the CR documents, only editorial and without substantial changes. As a result, there was no need for any transition call and director's decision. Nevertheless, I did, and received the approval of the Domain lead, see the request at

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-archive/2016Aug/0130.html

and the domain lead's approval at:

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-archive/2016Sep/0021.html

The documents are as follows
----------------------------

Web Annotation Data Model
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-model-20160906/

Web Annotation Vocabulary
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-vocab-20160906/

Web Annotation Protocol
http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-protocol-20160906/

The documents will be on the TR space within a day; they are, currently, at:

http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/admin/TR/annotation-model/Overview.html 
http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/admin/TR/annotation-vocab/Overview.html

and

respectively.

The documents are already in place and pass the new pubrules' checker (ie, specberus).

Thanks!
