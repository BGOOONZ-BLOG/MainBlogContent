### Draft Agenda

*   Sam Weiler has some pointers to conversation around Encrypted Client Hello (ECH, n√©e ESNI).

*   Francis McCabe would like to present thoughts on better integrating WASM and CSP.

*   [WebCrypto in our charter](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/pull/584)
    *   Interest in well-scoped additions (e.g. [ed25519](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/466), [UUID](https://github.com/WICG/uuid)). Other things on peoples' minds?

*   Odds and ends:
    *   Privacy CG face-to-face.
    *   Guidance documents: "Here's what you should do with all these mechanisms we've documented."
    *   Policy Container landed: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6504
    *   Credentiallessness: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6637, https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1229, https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1592
    *   Anonymous `<iframe>`: https://github.com/camillelamy/explainers/blob/master/anonymous_iframes.md
