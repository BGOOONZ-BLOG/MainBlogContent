### review comments ###

### Name of link element ###
[thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/3498180731fb8810)

```
I think that the meta and link pair already looks too similar to RDFa. 
I propose to rename link as externalRef. This is because we do not use 
link elements such as  <link rel="marcrel:aut" href="#creator">, which is 
common in RDFa, but we only use something like 
<link rel="onix-record" href="http://example.org/onix/12389347"/> 
```

### Additional prefix mappings ###
[thread](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/3498180731fb8810)

```
First, I propose to predefine even more prefixes [...]. Possible additions are FOAF (foaf:), PRISM (prism:), 
PRISM Inline Markup (pim:), PRISM Rights Language (prl:),  PRISM Aggregator 
Message (pam:), PRISM Usage Rights (pur:), PRISM Controlled Vocabulary (pcv:). 
```

  * Also, need to settle URI for marc relators

## Other final issues ##

  * update of dated css references and name changes in css speech (on: DanW) _status?_
  * ...

## Next Steps ##

## Minutes from Telcon ##

TOPIC: Metadata changes

Markus: Majority of changes are in spec docs, some work is still ongoing

Markus: some suggestions toward simplifying title expression, will continue to be reviewed / worked on

Markus: @scheme allowed on elements directly to reduce verbosity of metadata

Markus: DCMES fully allowed, as in EPUB 2

Markus: NCX marked as obsolete

Question from Murata-san: link element has @rel, what is purpose?

hober: s/rel/refines/

Answer: @rel used to relate one metadata element to another resource

ACTION: Markus / Matt Garrish: clarify usage of @rel in prose

Murata-san: concern that confusion regarding use of our link element colliding with RDF intended usage/intent could arise

Markus: link element and @href/@rel inherits from HTML, rationale is that there is common understanding based on HTML

hober: that was me, pre-george

Murata-san: recommends usage note clarifying intent wrt link element

ACTION: Matt Garrish: Usage note to clarify link element

TOPIC: Defined Prefixes

Bill Kasdorf: Input from Dianne Kennedy - PRISM is re-evaluating prefixes, may change, so defining would not be favorable at this time

http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/30/spec/epub30-publications.html#sec-prefix-attr

http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/30/spec/epub30-publications.html#sec-metadata-reserved-vocabs

Markus: perhaps only defining prefixes we are dependent on would be cleanest method

Markus: inclined to leave list as is: dcterms, marc, media, onix, xsd

http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relator instead of http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/ functions

Markus: URI may not necessarily have to resolve to RDF

DECISION: leave list of defined prefixes as-is

ACTION: Markus: follow-up with Daniel Weck wrt CSS

TOPIC: [Issue 149](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=149): http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=149

Issue concerns media-type registration

TOPIC: inconsistent licenses among schema and specs

ACTION: Markus to work on harmonizing licenses

TOPIC: Garth preparing overview of CSS changes between EPUB 2 and EPUB 3, removals, additions, and prefixed properties

ACTION: Garth to add informational document to wiki, email list to solicit review/feedback

TOPIC: Timeline for submission

Markus: Next step wrt to timeline is when we (as WG) can submit to IDPF Board.

Next board meeting is scheduled 20110901, submission would be required 48 hours prior

Bill McCoy: Ideally, a 'freeze' would be expected for 3.0, then look forward towards an 'errata' or maintenance release

Possible (likely) to postpone board meeting to 20110915

Markus: WG deadline 20110906 to finalize specs, then move to 48 hour review period for WG, then on 20110908 submit to IDPF Board

IDPF Membership voting period can range from 7 to 30 days, after Board review.
