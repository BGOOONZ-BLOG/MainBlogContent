    <h1 id="title">[EDITOR'S DRAFT] Verifiable Claims Working Group Charter</h1>

        <p class="mission">
It is currently difficult to express banking account information,
education qualifications, healthcare data, and other sorts of
machine-readable personal information that has been verified by a 3rd party
on the Web. These sorts of data are often referred to as
<strong>verifiable claims</strong>. The mission of the Verifiable Claims
Working Group is to make expressing, exchanging, and verifying claims easier
and more secure on the Web.
        </p>

        <p class="motivation">
Readers that are new to this work should examine the
<a href="charter-motivation.html">motivations that led to this charter</a>.
The
<a href="../primer/">Verifiable Claims Working Group Primer</a>

    <div class="introduction">
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
This working group is tasked with the standardization of a data model and
syntax for the expression of verifiable claims. The work proposed by this
charter has been incubated for over two years and has been demonstrated to
be
<a href="../support/">broadly supported by various industries</a>.
The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a>
has identified this work as being critical to achieving specific
<a href="../use-cases/">use cases</a>
related to commerce, education, and healthcare on the Web.
A document is available to those that wish to understand the
<a href="charter-motivation.html">motivations behind the creation of this charter</a>
and how this work fits into a broader vision for a
<a href="../architecture/">verifiable claims ecosystem</a>.
	    </p>

    </div>

    <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

	<p>The Working Group will:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
Recommend a data model and syntax(es) for the expression of verifiable claims,
including one or more core vocabularies.
    </li>
    <li>
Create a note specifying how these data models should be used with existing
attribute exchange protocols, a suggestion that existing protocols
should be modified, or a suggestion that a new protocol is required to
address the problems stated earlier in this document.
    </li>
    <li>
Focus their efforts on the identified
<a href="../use-cases/">use cases</a> with a particular focus on the
payments and education sectors. Use cases from other industries may be
included if there is significant industry participation.
    </li>
  </ol>

	<p>The Working Group will not:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Define browser-based APIs for interacting with verifiable claims. This work may be performed by a future Working Group if there is interest, but is not required for the Working Group to be successful.</li>
    <li>Define a new protocol for attribute exchange. This work may be performed by a future Working Group if there is interest, but is not required for the Working Group to be successful.</li>
    <li>Attempt to create supporting infrastructure, other than a data model and syntax(es), for a verifiable claims ecosystem.</li>
    <li>Attempt to address the larger problem of "Identity on the Web/Internet".</li>
  </ol>

	<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>

	<dl>
	  <dt id="claim"><strong>verifiable claim</strong></dt>
      <dd>A machine-readable statement made by an entity that is cryptographically authentic (non-repudiable).</dd>
	  <dt id="credential"><strong>credential (aka attestation)</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A set of verifiable claims that refer to a qualification, achievement, personal quality, aspect of an identity such as a name, government ID, preferred payment processor, home address, or university degree typically used to indicate suitability.</dd>
	</dl>

    <h3 id="security">Security and Privacy Considerations</h3>

   <p>
In general, the issuers of verifiable claims want to ensure that their
reputation is protected, the holders of verifiable claims want to
ensure their data is protected, and the inspectors of verifiable claims
want to be confident in their claims-based decisions. As a result,
both security and privacy are critical for verifiable claims.
   </p>

   <p>
From a security perspective it is important that verifiable claims are
protected from forgery and that interactions with verifiable claims are
protected from bad actors at all stages of the lifecycle.
   </p>

    <p>
From a privacy perspective it is important that information that is
intended to remain private is handled appropriately. Maintaining the
trust of a verifiable claims ecosystem is important. Verifiable
claims technology defined by this group should not disclose private
details of the participants' identity or other sensitive information
unless required for operational purposes, by legal or jurisdictional
rules, or when deliberately consented to (e.g. as part of a request
for information) by the holder of the information. The design of any
data model and syntax(es) should guard against the unwanted leakage of
such data.
    </p>

	<p>
The Working Group will work with the security and privacy organizations
listed in the liaisons section of the charter to help ensure that
both security and privacy are considered.
    </p>

    <h3 id="i18n-a11y">Internationalization and Accessibility Considerations</h3>

   <p>
Verifiable claims are made throughout the world and are issued and used by
a variety of organizations and people with varying languages and
levels of disabilities. The technology developed by the working group must
be able to express verifiable claims in a variety of languages and must
be able to be used by people with a variety of disabilities.
   </p>

   <p>
The Working Group will work with the internationalization and
accessibility organizations listed in the liaisons section of the charter
to help ensure that both internationalization and accessibility are
considered.

                A <strong>Data Model and Core Vocabularies</strong>: for expressing verifiable claims in a semantically extensible way.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Syntax(es)</strong>: that are machine-readable and capable of expressing the data model across a variety of formats.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Signature Mechanism(s)</strong>: that are capable of protecting the verifiable claims from attack such that the claims can be trusted by consumers of those claims.

        </ul>

        <h3 id="vc-implementation-guidance">Verifiable Claims Implementation Guidance</h3>

        <p>This NOTE will define or identify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
How the data model and syntax can be used with existing attribute exchange architectures to address all of the problems stated in this document, or
            </li>
            <li>
How the data model and syntax can be used with a set of modifications to existing attribute exchange architectures, or
            </li>
            <li>
If a new attribute exchange protocol is needed and if so, requirements for that protocol to address the problems identified in this document.

	<h3 id="process-planning">Process and Planning</h3>

        <h4 id="community-specs">Preference for Community Developed Specifications</h4>

	<p>The Working Group will actively seek to base its
deliverables on specifications that have been socialized
in <a href="/community/">W3C Community Groups</a> or contributed
as <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/">W3C Member
	    Submissions</a>.</p>

	<h4 id="interop-criteria">Interoperability Success Criteria</h4>

	<p>The Working Group will fulfill the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#implementation-experience">implementation experience required by the W3C Process</a> as follows:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The Working Group will develop test suites for Recommendation-track specifications.</li>
	  <li>The group will seek independent interoperable implementations by two software libraries.</li>
	  <li>For any implementation cited to establish interoperability success, the Working Group will work with the WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group (or its successor) to help communicate accessibility issues to the developers.</li>

        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this
            group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When a Chair puts a question and observes
            dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should put a question out for voting
            within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or
            web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
            considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.</p>

        <p>Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference (i.e., that does not follow a 7 day
            call for consensus on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional until 5 working days after the
            publication of the draft resolution. If no
            objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

    <h2 id="about">About this Charter</h2>

   <p>
Research that went into the creation of this charter was performed by the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a>
via the
<a href="http://w3c.github.io/vctf/">Verifiable Claims Task Force</a>.
The research findings can be found in the
<a href="VCTF-final-report.html">Verifiable Claims Task Force Final Report</a>.

The Web Payments Interest Group recommended that the Task Force draft a
charter to determine whether there is consensus within the community
(including those interviewed) for the scope of work.
   </p>


    <p>This charter for the Verifiable Claims Working Group has been created according to <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/groups#GAGeneral">section 5.2</a> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process">Process
        Document</a>. In the event of a conflict between this document or the provisions of any charter and the W3C
      Process, the W3C Process shall take precedence.</p>
