<h2>Make your Web app stick with an app manifest</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/">Manifest for Web applications</a> specification defines a JSON format that lets you describe your Web app with a name, a preferred start page, icons, and a specific display mode (e.g. fullscreen).</p>
<p>Mobile browsers are starting to use these manifests to facilitate the addition of Web apps to usersâ€™ home screens, a great way to keep your users just one-click away from your app!</p>
