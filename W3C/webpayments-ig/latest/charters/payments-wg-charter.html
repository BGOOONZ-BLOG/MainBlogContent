    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

   <p> Fragmentation of the payment landscape is limiting the
   full potential of the Web, including lack of standards in areas
   such as:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>the high level flow of a Web payment;</li>
	    <li>the programming interfaces between the
            various parties (such as between user agent and Web application);</li>
	    <li>the messages exchanged between these
              parties over the Web.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>If successful, the Recommendations from this Working Group will
increase some areas of interoperability between payer and payee
systems, producing benefits such as:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>A better checkout experience for users, particularly on mobile devices. The standards should facilitate automation, one approach to improving the user experience.</li>
        <li>Streamlined <a href="#payment_flow">payment flow</a>, which is expected to reduce the percentage of
            transactions abandoned prior to completion ("shopping cart abandonment").
        </li>
        <li>Easier adoption of payment instrument improvements (e.g., related to security) or new payment instruments.
        </li>
        <li>Added value through machine-readable digital payment requests and payment responses.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more background information about this group, please see
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/Web_Payments_WG_Charter_FAQ">Web
Payments Working Group Charter FAQ</a>. For more information about Web
Payments activities beyond the scope of this charter, see
the <a href="#wpig">Web Payments Interest Group</a> description below.
</p>

    <p>Under this charter, the Working Group defines Recommendations that allow for a payment to be initiated within a Web application.</p>

    <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

	<p>The Working Group will Recommend:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>a set of messages that can be used to accomplish a payment,</li>
    <li>message flows for the initiation and, where scheme-permitting, confirmation or
completion of a payment, and</li>
    <li>an API to allow Web applications to participate in these flows.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The Working Group will also Recommend how Web applications and digital payment instruments exchange these messages through a mediating user agent; see the <a href="#deliverables">deliverables</a> section for further detail.</p>

	<p>This Working Group is chartered to Recommend programming
	  interfaces; not user interfaces.</p>

	<p>This Working Group will not define a
	new <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment
	    scheme</a>.</p>

	<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

	<dl>
	  <dt id="digital-payment-scheme"><strong>digital payment scheme</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A set of rules for the execution of payment transactions that are followed by adhering entities (payment processors, payers and payees), where transactions take place over networks (such as the Web). Some digital payment schemes make use internally of payment instruments from other payment schemes. How they register and communicate with internal payment instruments is beyond the scope of this charter. </dd>
	  <dt id="digital-payment-instrument"><strong>digital payment instrument</strong></dt>
	  <dd>An account, token, or other means of fulfilling the payment provider's role in a digital payment scheme.</dd>
	  <dt id="digital-wallet"><strong>digital wallet</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A logical container for digital payment instruments. A
	  digital wallet affords access to digital payment
	  instruments, providing registration and discovery of digital
	  payment instruments. In this charter, a digital wallet is an
	  entity that provides these functions by fulfilling the
	  specified APIs for registration and discovery. The entity
	  fulfilling the APIs may be a user agent, or a user agent
	  may ultimately locate payment instruments via other more
	  specialized digital wallets.</dd>
	</dl>

        <h3 id="capabilities">Required Capabilities</h3>

          <p>The Working Group will specify the following capabilities, in order to
            support a payment from a payer to a payee, whether a credit push (payer initiated)
            or a debit pull (payee initiated):</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Pre-Payment</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Registration</strong> of the payer's <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="//www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/#negotiation-of-payment-terms">Negotiation of Terms</a></dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Payment Request</strong>, by the payee to the payer providing the terms of
                        the payment including elements such as the accepted <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment schemes</a>, price, currency,
                        recurrence, transaction type, timeout and requests for any additional
                        data that is required from the payee.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="//www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/#negotiation-of-payment-instruments">Negotiation of Payment Instruments</a></dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discovery</strong>, by the payer, of their available <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a> that can be
                        used to make the payment. This is done by matching those registered by the payer with those
                        supported by the payee (as defined in the Payment Request), while keeping information
                        local to
                        the payer.
                    </li>
		    <li><strong>Payment Response</strong> from the digital payment instrument, which may vary according to digital payment scheme. For example, for a credit push instrument, the response may include a notification or proof of execution of the payment. For a debit pull instrument, the response may include the information necessary for the payee to execute the payment.</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        </dl>

	<p>In addition to these capabilities, user agents and digital
	wallets are expected to fulfill a variety of roles (e.g.,
	displaying a selection of payment instruments and enabling the
	user to select one) that will not be specified in the
	deliverables of this Working Group.</p>

		<p>The Working Group will consider support for deferred payment execution to enable use cases where the actual execution of a payment requires steps that are out-of-band with respect to the message flows and APIs defined by the Working Group.</p>

        <p>The Working Group will also address exceptions that may occur during these steps, including payment authorization
          failure, lack of available <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a>, and lack of suitable
    <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="digital_wallets">Digital Wallets</h3>

	  <p>The Working Group may define APIs that will also be used
   outside of a user agent context, such as between Web services, or
	    from within a native application (where the proxy between the payer's digital payment instruments and the payee's application is not a browser).</p>

	  <p>If the Working Group specifies interactions with a digital wallet, the Working Group will assure that users are able to use more than one digital wallet. The phrase "the payer's digital wallet" is shorthand for "the payer's digital wallet(s)."</p>

	   <p>The Working Group may consider the use case where an aggregation service acts as a more sophisticated digital wallet or provides a wider choice of payment solutions to the payer. For example, the aggregator service might combine the functionality of multiple digital wallets, or apply more complex algorithms to discover and collect the set of <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment
               instruments</a> available to the payer.</p>

		        <p>Recommendations for loyalty
  schemes and coupons, digital receipts, digital credentials,
  tickets, and location services are out of scope.  Future W3C activities may seek to
  increase interoperability of these or other additional digital wallet
  capabilities.</p>

        <h3 id="security">Security and Privacy Considerations</h3>

	<p>Security is obviously critical in payments.</p>

	<p>A key consideration is
 the ability to prove message integrity and authentication of all
 message originators. The Working Group will work with the organizations
 listed in the liaisons section of the charter to help ensure API
 security.</p>

       <p> There are other aspects of security (e.g., authentication
 of payer identity) that the Working Group will leave to individual <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment schemes</a>.
 The Working Group will not define authentication mechanisms (e.g.,
 hardware-based solutions in securing transactions, or authenticating
 users via biometry or other mechanisms) but should be aware of
 industry developments to help ensure compatibility with the flows
 defined by this group.</p>

       <p>In addition, W3C might develop additional security-related
 specifications in other groups that may be adopted in <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment
 schemes</a>. This group will follow any such work to help ensure
 compatibility with the payment flows described in this
 charter.</p>

       <p>Protection of the privacy of all participants in a payment
 is essential to maintaining the trust that payment systems are
 dependent upon to function. A payment process defined by this group
 should not disclose private details of the participants' identity or
 other sensitive information unless
 required for operational purposes, by legal or jurisdictional rules, or when
 deliberately consented to (e.g. as part of a loyalty program) by the
 owner of the information. The design of any API should
 guard against the unwanted leakage of such data through exploitation
 of the API.</p>

	   <h3 id="regulatory">Relation to Regulatory Requirements</h3>

	<p><a href="#digital-payment-scheme">Digital payment schemes</a> define how various parties meet relevant regulatory obligations. The deliverables of this group should not prevent parties from meeting those obligations.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

        <h3 id="Web_Payments_Terms">Web Payments Messages Recommendation</h3>

        <p>This Recommendation will define message formats for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Digital Payment Scheme Description</strong>: used by payees to represent accepted
                schemes, and by payers to represent their available schemes and instruments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Payment Terms Description</strong>: used to define the terms requested by the payee in
                the payment request and the terms accepted by the payer in the payment response.
                It includes information such as amount, currency, payee account information, recurrence, transaction
                reference and any scheme-specific data that is required.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proof of Payment</strong>: scheme and instrument permitting, a payment authorization from the account provider to the payee. The
                proof must include information about the payment request (a transaction reference or similar) and the
                payer's <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instrument</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

	<p>These messages will be exchanged by the APIs described below, but can also be used without them (e.g., for server-to-server communication).</p>

        <h3 id="Web_Payments_APIs">Web Payments APIs Recommendation</h3>	

        <p>This Recommendation will specify request and response messages for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Registration</strong>: A payment provider requests to register a <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instrument</a> for use by the payer.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Web Payment Request</strong>: The payee passes a payment request through a user agent, causing the payer to be presented with a set
                of <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a> for selection, and prompting the payer to provide any other required data to pass back to the payee.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Instrument Response</strong>: After a payer has selected their chosen payment instrument, the payment instrument sends data back to the payee (either indicating payment has completed, or with information to enable the payee to cause the payment to be completed).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It will specify the delivery mechanism for these messages in at least the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web application to user agent integration</strong>: Where the payment messages may be proxied between a Web application and the payer's digital payment instruments via a JavaScript API hosted by a user agent.
            </li>
            <li><strong>User agent to server-side wallet communication</strong>: Where request messages are passed to a server-side wallet, for example via HTTP, JavaScript, or some other approach.
            </li>
	    <li><strong>User agent to digital payment instrument communication</strong> : For the request and response messages for the digital payment instrument response, the payment messages are sent between a user agent and a registered digital payment instrument.</li>
            <li><strong>Inter-app on mobile devices (Optional)</strong>: If possible the group will Recommend a delivery mechanism for payment messages between apps on a mobile device so that digital wallet applications can seamlessly interface with Websites running inside a mobile device's user agent.
            </li>
        </ul>

	<h3 id="process-planning">Process and Planning</h3>

        <h4 id="community-specs">Preference for Community Developed Specifications</h4>

	<p>The Working Group will actively seek to base its
deliverables on specifications that have been socialized
in <a href="/community/">W3C Community Groups</a> or contributed
as <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/">W3C Member
	    Submissions</a>.</p>

	<h4 id="interop-criteria">Interoperability Success Criteria</h4>

	<p>The Working Group will fulfill the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#implementation-experience">implementation experience required by the W3C Process</a> as follows:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The Working Group will develop test suites for Recommendation-track specifications.</li>
	  <li>The group will seek independent interoperable implementations by two user agents and two services that enable payers to use
	    <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment
   instruments</a>.</li>
	  <li>One of the user agent implementations must be native (that is, part of the distributed user agent code).</li>
	  <li>For implementations cited to establish interoperability success that are not native to the user agent, we will ask user agent developers provide feedback on the suitability and traction of the implementation approach.</li>
	  <li>For any native implementation cited to establish interoperability success, the Working Group will work with the WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group (or its successor) to help communicate accessibility issues to the user agent developers.</li>

        <p>A very large proportion of payments on the Web are conducted using payment cards from one of the global card
            schemes. The group should attempt to define a specialization of the payment flow specifically
            for payment cards.</p>

        <p>A generic card payment Note could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrate how a debit-pull digital payment scheme should be implemented using Web Payments APIs.
            </li>
            <li>Take advantage of new security technologies such as EMVco Tokenization to improve on the existing
                methods of using cards on the Web.
            </li>
            <li>Offer a common approach for payment card schemes
 globally to kick-start adoption of Web Payments APIs.

      <h3 id="wpig">Web Payments Interest Group</h3>

      <p>The <a href="/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a> acts as the overall coordinator at W3C of a vision for Web Payments, by gathering <a
                    href="/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Web Payments Use Cases</a>, engaging in liaisons with other payments standards bodies, and developing a high-level architecture. From time to time, the Interest Group will seek feedback from the Working Group on its evolving vision, and share information about the evolution of the Web payments technology landscape. The Web Payments Interest Group also expects to provide technical input to this and other relevant W3C Working Groups, based on a detailed analysis of the relevant Web Payments Use Cases.</p>

    <div class="participation">
        <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

        <p>To be successful, the Web Payments Working Group is expected to have 10 active participants for its duration.
            Effective participation in Web Payments Working Group may consume .1 FTE for each participant; for editors
          this commitment may be higher.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="communication">
        <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

        <p>This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list public-payments-wg@w3.org (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-payments-wg/">archive</a>).
            Administrative tasks may be conducted in Member-only communications.</p>

        <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is
            available from the Web Payments Working Group home page.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="decisions">
        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this
            group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When a Chair puts a question and observes
            dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should put a question out for voting
            within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or
            web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
            considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.</p>

        <p>Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference (i.e., that does not follow a 7 day
            call for consensus on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional until 5 working days after the
            publication of the draft resolution. If no
            objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="patent">
        <h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Policy</h2>
