      <h1>5G Applications</h1>
      <p>The new network capabilities and performances enabled by 5G and its accompanying evolutions (SDN, MEC, â€¦) are only meaningful if they can be exploited to their full extent at the application layer, of which the Web is a critical component.</p>
      <p>We review here what specifications enable these expected usages of 5G capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>
        <p data-feature="Video distribution"><a data-featureid="video">HTML5 videos</a> and their supporting technologies (<a data-featureid="mse">adaptive streaming with Media Source Extension</a>, <a data-featureid="eme">integration with DRM systems with Encrypted Media Extension</a>) have made the distribution of video content a major driver of network usage.</p>
        <p data-feature="Audio/Video calls"><a data-featureid="p2p">Web Real-Time Communications</a> enable high-definition audio and video calls on any device with a Web browser, and serve as a basis for a growing number of communications in native applications as well.</p>
          <p data-feature="Augmented Reality">Web technologies provide a good basis for mobile-based augmented reality applications thanks to the combination of <a data-featureid="geolocation">geolocation API</a>, <a data-featureid="deviceorientation">orientation detection</a>, 3D graphics with WebGL, <a data-featureid="getusermedia">camera API</a>.</p>

          <h2>Specifications in progress</h2>
          <p data-feature="Connected Cars">The <a data-featureid="vehicle-info">Vehicle Information Access API</a> enables developers to build applications that integrate in real-time with the various sensors and actuators available in vehicle, bringing new opportunities for integrating connected cars in the Internet of Things.</p>
          <p data-feature="Sensors and IoT">The <a data-featureid="generic-sensor">Generic Sensor Framework</a> and its accompanying concrete APIs (<a data-featureid="accelerometer">acceleratometer</a>, <a data-featureid="gyroscope">gyroscope</a>, <a data-featureid="magnetometer">magnetometer</a>, <a data-featureid="orientation">orientation</a>) provide a systematic mechanism for Web-enabled devices to bring data to the Internet of Things.</p>
          <p data-feature="Virtual Reality">The Web provides a unique opportunity to build and distribute Virtual Reality content on a wide set of devices - the <a data-featureid="webxr">WebXR Device API</a> is a critical enabler for that usage, and can be used a first step towards Mixed reality usages.</p>

        <section class="featureset exploratory-work">
          <h2>Exploratory work</h2>
          <p data-feature="Sensors and IoT">The <a data-featureid="webbluetooth">Web Bluetooth</a>, <a data-featureid="webnfc">Web NFC</a>, and <a data-featureid="webusb">Web USB</a> API make Web applications integrate with their surrounding connected objects, opening up new ways for networked applications to read from and interact with the physcal environment.</p>
          <p data-feature="Industry Automation">The Web of Things effort, in particular the <a data-featureid="wot-description">Web of Things Description</a> and <a data-featureid="wot-api">its associated API</a>, is set to bring a uniform application layer for connected objects, bringing much needed programmability to the Internet of Things.</p>

            <dt>Mixed Reality applications</dt>
            <dd>Beyond the capabilities already available for mobile-based augmented reality and virtual reality (described above), for the Web to become a strong platform for Mixed Reality applications will at least require improved primitives for real-time video-processing, better management and streaming of 3D assets.</dd>
