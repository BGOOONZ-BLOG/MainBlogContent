        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string" xml:lang="en"> This is the ITS 2.0 / RDF
            Ontology version 8 October 2015.
            
            The ontology is used to express ITS 2.0 so-called "data categories" as linked data. For more information about ITS 2.0, see http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/
            
            ITS 2.0 has been produced by the W3C MultilingualWeb-LT working group, see http://www.w3.org/International/multilingualweb/lt/
            
            This ontology is being maintained by the W3C ITS Interest Group, see http://www.w3.org/International/its/ig/
            
            Please note that this file may change without notice. For updated information, please refer to the latest version of Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) Version 2.0 specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/ and the ITS IG page at http://www.w3.org/International/its/ig/
        
        The ITS 2.0 / RDF Ontology is an an RDF/OWL-based format that represents information to foster automated creation and processing of multilingual Web content. The ontology provides definitions of RDF properties that exactly align with the so-called "data categories" provided in the ITS 2.0 specification. The difference is the usage scenario. The ITS 2.0 specification defines usages of ITS in markup, the ontology defines usage in linked data.
        
        Like with ITS 2.0 itself, the main purpose of this ontology is to express information in source content in one or several languages that then can be taken up in multilingual workflows. An example of such information are the "Translate" data category and the "translate" RDF property. They trigger in translation workflows whether a human translator or a machine translation system should change a particular piece of content.
        
        Because of role of ITS, its actually usage often involves both source content and workflow formats. An XML format for multilingual workflows is XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format). As of writing, native ITS support is prepared for the upcoming XLIFF version 2.1. A prominent usage scenario of the ITS ontology in the realm of linked data workflows involving natural language is NIF (Natural Language Processing Interchange format). Another potential usage scenario is the W3C Annotation model, see http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/ , or in localization workflows as discussed in the BPMLOD community group http://www.w3.org/community/bpmlod/wiki/Use_cases_definition#Localization_Workflow
        
        Linked data examples that show the usage of this ontology in NIF can be found the via FREME API http://api.freme-project.eu/doc/current/ . A prototypical example file in XML and its counterpart involving NIF can be found here:
        
        https://github.com/w3c/itsrdf/blob/master/its-in-markup.xml
        https://github.com/w3c/itsrdf/blob/master/its-in-linked-data.json
        
        The ontology contains only properties that express the same information as the related ITS 2.0 data categories. Each property definition has a link to the underlying data category section in the ITS 2.0 specification.</rdfs:comment>

		Possible values are "description" or "alert":
		 • An alert contains information that the translator has to read before translating a piece of text. Example: an instruction to the translator to leave parts of the text in the source language.
		 • A description provides useful background information that the translator will refer to only if they wish. Example: a clarification of ambiguity in the source text.

		<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The locNote property is based on the ITS "Localization Note" data category. The property is used to communicate notes to localizers about a particular item of content.
		This property can be used for several purposes, including, but not limited to:
		 • Tell the translator how to translate parts of the content
		 • Expand on the meaning or contextual usage of a specific resource, such as what a variable refers to or how a string will be used in the user interface
		 • Clarify ambiguity and show relationships between resources sufficiently to allow correct translation (e.g., in many languages it is impossible to translate the word"enabled" in isolation without knowing the gender, number, and case of the thing it refers to.)
		 • Indicate why a piece of text is emphasized (important, sarcastic, etc.)
			
		Editing tools may offer an easy way to create this type of information. Translation tools can be made to recognize the difference between these two types of localization notes, and present the information to translators in different ways.

    <owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its/rdf#dir">
		<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
		The dir property is based on the ITS "Directionality" data category. 
		This property allows the user to specify the base writing direction of blocks, embeddings, and overrides for the Unicode bidirectional algorithm. It has four possible values: "ltr", "rtl", "lro" and "rlo".

			Note:
			ITS defines only the values of the Directionality data category and their inheritance. The behavior of text labeled in this way may vary, according to the implementation. Implementers are encouraged, however, to model the behavior on that described in the CSS 2.1 specification or its successor. In such a case, the effect of the data category's values would correspond to the following CSS rules:
				• Data category value: "ltr" (left-to-right text)
				• CSS rule: *[dir="ltr"] { unicode-bidi: embed; direction: ltr}
				• Data category value: "rtl" (right-to-left text)
				• CSS rule: *[dir="rtl"] { unicode-bidi: embed; direction: rtl}
				• Data category value: "lro" (left-to-right override)
				• CSS rule: *[dir="lro"] { unicode-bidi: bidi-override; direction: ltr}
				• Data category value: "rlo" (right-to-left override)
				• CSS rule: *[dir="rlo"] { unicode-bidi: bidi-override; direction: rtl} 

			Note:
			At the time of writing, enhancements are being discussed in the context of HTML5 that are expected to change the approach to marking up Directionality, in particular to support content where directionality needs to be isolated from that of surrounding content. However, these enhancements are not finalized yet. This section therefore reflects directionality markup in [HTML 4.01]; enhancements in HTML5 will be reflected in a future revision.	
				
			More information about how to use this data category is provided by [Bidi Article](http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#bidiarticle).

		<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
		The withinText property is based on the ITS "Elements Within Text" data category. 
		This property reveals if and how an resource affects the way text content behaves from a linguistic viewpoint. This information is for example relevant to provide basic text segmentation hints for tools such as translation memory systems. The values associated with this property are:
		 • "yes": The resource is part of the flow of its parent resource. For example like the element strong in [XHTML 1.0]:
		   &lt;strong&gt;Appaloosa horses&lt;/strong&gt; have spotted coats.
		 • "nested": The resource is part of the flow of its parent resource, its content is an independent flow. For example like the element fn in [DITA 1.0]:
			Palouse horses&lt;fn&gt;A Palouse horse is the same as an Appaloosa.&lt;/fn&gt; have spotted coats.
		 • "no": The resource splits the text flow of its parent resource and its content is an independent text flow. For example like the element p when inside the element li in DITA or XHTML:
			&lt;li&gt;Palouse horses: &lt;p&gt;They have spotted coats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They have been bred by the Nez Perce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

		<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
		The domains property is based on the ITS "Domain" data category. 
		This property is used to identify the topic or subject of the resource. Such information allows for more relevant linguistic choices during various processes.

		Examples of usage include:
			 • Allowing machine translation systems to select the most appropriate engine and rules to translate the content.
			 • Providing a general indication of what terminology collection is most suitable for use by translators.

		This data category addresses various challenges:
			 • Often domain-related information already exists in the document (e.g., keywords in the HTML meta element). The Domain data category provides a mechanism to point to this information.
			 • There are many flat or structured lists of domain related values, keywords, key phrases, classification codes, ontologies, etc. The Domain data category does not propose its own given list. Instead it provides a mapping mechanism to associate the values in the document with the values used by the consumer tool.

		The localeFilterList property is based on the ITS "Local Filter" data category.
		It specifies that a resource is only applicable to certain locales and interacts with the localeFilterType property.

		This property can be used for several purposes, including, but not limited to:
			• Including a legal notice only in locales for certain regions.
			• Dropping editorial notes from all localized output.

		The list is comma-separated and can include the wildcard extended language range "*". The list can also be empty. Whitespace surrounding language ranges is ignored.
		
		This property interacts with the localeFilterType property in the following way: 
			 • A single wildcard "*" with a localeFilterType "include" indicates that the resource applies to all locales.
			 • A single wildcard "*" with a localeFilterType "exclude" indicates that the resource applies to no locale.
			 • An empty string with a localeFilterType "include" indicates that the resource applies to no locale.
			 • An empty string with a localeFilterType "exclude" indicates that the resource applies to all locales.
			 • Otherwise, with a localeFilterType "include", the resource applies to the locales for which the language tag has a match in the list when using the Extended Filtering algorithm defined in [BCP47](http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#bcp47).
			 • If, instead, the localeFilterType is "exclude", the resource applies to the locales for which the language tag does not have a match in the list when using the Extended Filtering algorithm defined in [BCP47](http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#bcp47).

		<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
		The hasProvRecord property is based on the ITS "Provenance" data category.		
		The property is used to communicate the identity of agents that have been involved in the translation of the content or the revision of the translated resource. This allows translation and translation revision consumers, such as post-editors, translation quality reviewers, or localization workflow managers, to assess how the performance of these agents may impact the quality of the translation. Translation and translation revision agents can be identified as a person, a piece of software or an organization that has been involved in providing a translation that resulted in the resource. 
		
		The provRecord offers three types of information. First, it allows identification of translation agents. Second, it allows identification of revision agents. Third, if provenance information is needed that includes temporal or sequence information about translation processes (e.g. multiple revision cycles) or requires agents that support a wider range of activities, this property offers a mechanism to refer to external provenance information.

			Note:
			The specification does not define the format of external provenance information, but it is recommended that an open provenance or change-logging format be used, e.g. the W3C provenance data model [PROV-DM].

		Translation or translation revision tools, such as machine translation engines or computer assisted translation tools, may offer an easy way to create this information. Translation tools can then present this information to post-editors or translation workflow managers. Web applications may to present such information to consumers of translated documents.
		
			Note:
			The tool related provenance and tool related revision provenance pieces of information are not meant to express information about tools used for creating ITS annotations themselves. For this purpose, ITS 2.0 provides a separate mechanism. See http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#its-tool-annotation for details, especially http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#annotators-ref-usage-scenarios.

		The hasLocQualityIssue property is based on the ITS "Localization Quality Issue" data category. 
		This property is used to express information related to localization quality assessment tasks.  Such tasks can be conducted on the translation of some source content (such as a text or an image) into a target language or on the source content itself where its quality may impact on the localization process.

			Note:
			Automated or manual quality assessment is one area of quality management for translation and localization. An example of existing quality assessment is in-country review (e.g., as part of a language acceptance test for software). An important part of quality assessment is the list of issue types that are being used. Very often, simple issue categories like "correct/incorrect" or "like/dislike" are inadequate; instead, more specific ones such as "terminology" or "grammar" are more helpful in identifying concrete reasons for quality problems and for obtaining a more objective picture of quality levels.
			Non-normative terminology related to localization quality as used in this section is provided in Appendix H: Localization Quality Guidance, see http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#localization-quality-guidance.
			
		This property can be used in a number of ways, including the following example scenarios:
			 • A human reviewer working with a web-based tool adds quality markup manually in a text editor, including comments and suggestions, to localized content as part of the review process. A subsequent process examines this markup to ensure that changes were made.
			 • A fully automatic quality checking tool flags a number of potential quality issues in an XML or HTML file and marks them up using ITS 2.0 markup. A human reviewer then uses another tool to examine this markup and decide whether the file needs to receive more extensive review or be passed on for further processing without a further manual review stage.
			 • A quality assessment process identifies a number of issues and adds the ITS markup to a rendered HTML preview of an XML file along with CSS styling that highlights these issues. The resulting HTML file is then sent back to the translator to assist his or her revision efforts.

    <owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its/rdf#mtConfidence">
		<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
		The mtConfidence property is based on the ITS "MT Confidence" data category.
		This property is used to communicate the confidence score from a machine translation engine for the accuracy of a translation it has provided. It is not intended to provide a score that is comparable between machine translation engines and platforms. This data category does NOT aim to establish any sort of correlation between the confidence score and either human evaluation of MT usefulness, or post-editing cognitive effort. For harmonization’s sake, MT Confidence is provided as a rational number in the interval 0 to 1 (inclusive).

			Note:
			Implementers are expected to interpret the floating-point number and present it to human and other consumers in a convenient form, such as percentage (0-100%) with up to 2 decimal digits, font or background color coding, etc.

			Note:
			The value provided by the MT Confidence data category can be 1) the quality score of the translation as produced by an MT engine, or 2) a quality estimation score that uses both MT-system-internal features and additional external features. For this reason it is important that MT Confidence provides additional information about the MT engine (via the annotatorsRef property). Otherwise the score on its own is hard to interpret and to reuse. In the case of 2), MT Confidence potentially conveys information about any additional tools that were used in deriving the score.
			
		This property can be used for several purposes, including, but not limited to:
			 • Automated prioritising of raw machine translated text for further processing based on empirically set thresholds.
			 • Providing readers, translators, post-editors, reviewers, and proof-readers of machine translated text with self-reported relative accuracy prediction.

		MT confidence scores can be displayed e.g., on websites machine translated on the fly, by simple web-based translation editors or by Computer Aided Translation (CAT) tools.
		
		The value of this property represents the translation confidence score as a rational number in the interval 0 to 1 (inclusive). 
		
		If this property is set, the mtConfidenceAnnotatorsRef has to be set also. See http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#its-tool-annotation for further information.

		<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">
		The allowedCharacters property is based on the ITS "Allowed Characters" data category.
		This property is used to specify the characters that are permitted in a given piece of content.

		It can be used for various purposes, including the following examples:
			 • Limiting the characters that may be used in the UI of a game due to font restrictions.
			 • Preventing illegal characters from being entered as text content that represents file or directory names.
			 • Controlling what characters can be used when translating examples of a login name in content.

			Note:
			The Allowed Characters data category is not intended to disallow HTML markup. The purpose is to restrict the content to various characters only, e.g., when the content is to be used for URL or filename generation. In most Content Management Systems, content is divided into several fields, some of which may be restricted to plain text, while in other fields HTML fragments may be allowed. Enforcing such restrictions is outside the scope of this property.

		The set of characters that are allowed is specified using a regular expression. That is, each character in the selected content MUST be included in the set specified by the regular expression.

		The regular expression is the character class construct charClass defined as follows:
			[1] charClass ::= singleCharEsc | charClassExpr | wildcardEsc
			[2] singleCharEsc ::= '\' [nrt\|.?*+(){}#x2D#x5B#x5D#x5E]
			[3] charClassExpr ::= '[' charGroup ']'
			[4] charGroup ::= posCharGroup | negCharGroup
			[5] posCharGroup ::= ( charRange | singleCharEsc )+
			[6] charRange ::= seRange | xmlCharIncDash
			[7] seRange ::= charOrEsc '-' charOrEsc
			[8] charOrEsc ::= xmlChar | singleCharEsc
			[9] xmlChar ::= [^\#x2D#x5B#x5D]
			[10] xmlCharIncDash ::= [^\#x5B#x5D]
			[11] negCharGroup ::= '^' posCharGroup
			[12] wildcardEsc ::= '.'

		The . metacharacter also matches CARRIAGE RETURN (U+000D) and LINE FEED (U+000F). That is the dot-all option is set.

		This construct is a sub-set of the Character Classes construct of XML Schema [XML Schema Part 2] and is compatible with most other regular expression engines.

			Note:
			Users may want to use a regular expression to make sure that they follow the definition given above. Sample regular expressions to verify the regular expression in allowed characters are provided: for XML (see http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/examples/allowed-characters-verify-xml-regex.txt) and for Java (see http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/examples/allowed-characters-verify-java-regex.txt).

		Example of expressions (shown as XML source):
			 • &quot;[abc]&quot;: allows the characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.
			 • &quot;[a-c]&quot;: allows the characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.
			 • &quot;[a-zA-Z]&quot;: allows the characters from 'a' to 'z' and from 'A' to 'Z'.
			 • &quot;[^abc]&quot;: allows any characters except 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
			 • &quot;[^&amp;#x0061;-c]&quot;: allows any characters except 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
			 • &quot;[^&amp;lt;&gt;:&amp;quot;\\/|\?*]&quot;: allows only the characters valid for Windows file names.
			 • &quot;.&quot;: allows any character.
			 • &quot;&quot;: allows no character.

		It defines the maximum number of bytes the text of the selected node is allowed in storage.
		
		It can be used for various purposes, including the following examples:
			 • Verify during translation if a string fits into a fixed-size database field.
			 • Control the size of a string that is stored in a fixed-size memory buffer at run-time.

		The storage size is always expressed in bytes and excludes any leading Byte-Order-Markers. It is provided along with the character encoding and the line break type that will be used when the content is stored. If the encoding form does not use the byte as its unit (e.g. UTF-16 uses 16-bit code units) the storage size MUST still be given in byte (e.g., for UTF-16: 2 bytes per 16-bit code unit).

		An application verifying the storage size for a given content is expected to perform the following steps:
			 • All the LINE FEED (U+000A) characters of the content to verify are replaced by the character or characters specified by the line break type.
			 • The resulting string is converted to an array of bytes using a character encoder for the specified encoding. If a character cannot be represented with the specified encoding, an error is generated.
			 • If the leading bytes represent a Byte-Order-Mark, they are stripped from that array.
			 • The length of the resulting array is compared to the storage size provided. The content is too long if the length is greater than the storage size.

			Note:
			Storage size is not directly related to the display length of a text, and therefore is not intended as a display length constraint mechanism.

		The storageEncoding property is based on the ITS "Storage Size" data category.
		The value of this property holds the name of the character encoding used to calculate the number of bytes of the selected text. The name MUST be one of the names or aliases listed in the IANA Character Sets registry [IANA Character Sets]. The default value is "UTF-8".

		The lineBreakType property is based on the ITS "Storage Size" data category.
		The value of this property indicates what type of line breaks the storage uses. The possible values are: "cr" for CARRIAGE RETURN (U+000D), "lf" for LINE FEED (U+000A), or "crlf" for CARRIAGE RETURN (U+000D) followed by LINE FEED (U+000A). The default value is "lf".
