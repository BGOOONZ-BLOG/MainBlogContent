      <p class="mission">
        The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> is to counter the fragmentation of the 
        Internet of Things by complementing available standards through Web technology capable of
        interconnecting existing Internet of Things platforms, devices, gateways, and cloud services.
        We aim to reduce costs through the global reach of Web standards, to enable open markets of services, and to unleash the power of the network effect.
        As a W3C Interest Group, we are seeking to build a deeper understanding of the Web of Things by investigating consumer, industrial, environmental, 
        energy management, and smart city scenarios.
        This is intended to identify demand for further standards-track work within W3C working groups and to better align with the established W3C liaisons.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Internet of Things (IoT) suffers from a lack of interoperability across platforms.
          As a result developers are faced with data silos, high integration and maintenance costs, and limited market potential.
          Existing IoT standards address only limited ecosystems and do not provide interoperability across domains.
          The current IoT is like the Internet before the World Wide Web, with competing incompatible hypertext systems.
          The W3C is applying lessons learned from the World Wide Web to the Internet of Things to create the Web of Things.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve this goal for cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability,
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Web of Things Working Group</a> is developing a first set of standardized building blocks.
          The core idea is based upon rich metadata that describes the data and possible interactions (i.e., affordances) exposed to applications,
          and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively.
          The central documents are the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">WoT Architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a> with its <i>Properties, Actions, Events</i> interaction model.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> continues its work to support the WoT Working Group and to explore opportunities for new standards-track work within W3C.
          The priority in this third charter period is gaining additional practical experience with the in-development building blocks in the field
          to enable open markets of services on the scale of the Web.
          To achieve this goal, the Interest Group is seeking to broaden the range of participants to provide the necessary skills and resources for real-world application scenarios in different verticals.

          The Web of Things Interest Group (WoT IG) is a forum for discussion of ideas relating to the Web of Things
          and is intended to complement the role of the Web of Things Working Group (WoT WG).
          In particular, the WoT IG will propose new work items based upon new requirements, use cases,
          and discussions with IoT developer communities, 
          standards development organizations,
          industry alliances,
          and vertical industry solution and infrastructure providers.
          Conversely, the WoT IG will consider new topics that are submitted to it by the WoT WG.
        </p>

        <p>
          An important activity is the operation of PlugFests to collect interoperability implementation experience 
          and to validate the current working assumptions of the potential building blocks discussed in the Web of Things Interest Group.
          These events enable developers to get together to test their implementations and facilitates networking between partners and experts.
          The Interest Group will seek to encourage work on open source projects and community evaluation of the Web of Things.
          In more detail, PlugFests allow participants to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>assist with preparing implementation reports for WoT WG Candidate Recommendations</li>
          <li>test-drive upcoming or proposed technologies for the W3C Recommendation Track</li>
          <li>identify and test-drive upcoming or proposed technologies as they apply to the collection of technologies required to address specific industry and user community needs</li>
          <li>take part in interoperability experiments across implementations for ideas at different levels of maturity</li>
          <li>reach out to other communities and new members through an OpenDay for non-members, which usually includes a demo track</li>
          <li>ensure interoperability between WoT technologies and assistive technologies used by people with disabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The Interest Group will identify requirements for standardization in two ways: first, by exploring use cases and requirements for concrete consumer, industrial, 
          environmental, energy management, and smart cities application scenarios, and second, through examining the requirements for integrating a broad range of IoT platforms into the Web of Things.
          The exploration tasks that the Interest Group will undertake may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>use cases and requirements for different application scenarios and user communities</li>
          <li>lifecycle management of Things</li>
          <li>Thing Template format and mechanisms</li>
          <li>clarify relationship with the concept of Digital Twins</li>
          <li>out-of-the-box device onboarding to cloud services</li>
          <li>WoT Scripting API and possible simplifications</li>
          <li>hypermedia-driven interactions for complex/multi-step Actions and Events</li>
          <li>community-driven, bottom-up vocabulary to enable semantic interoperability</li>
          <li>Concrete protocol bindings (e.g. for HTTP, WebSockets, CoAP)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Further ideas for topics are expected from discussions and expert presentations of IoT projects,
          including for example,
          Graph Data,
          Edge Computing,
          Machine Learning.
          The Interest Group will incubate work items for the Web of Things until they are ready for transfer to the W3C Recommendation Track, 
          either in existing Working Groups, such as the WoT WG, or in new Working Groups.
        </p>

        <p>
          The use case and requirement documents developed by the Interest Group should represent the needs of an international set of users.
          Users may be either working wholly in a non-Latin script, or in an environment where different actors are using different languages.
          Any requirements and use cases arising from investigation of international use should,
          of course, then be reflected in the experience and/or implementation reports for identified building blocks and any primer,
          best practice, or test case documents.
        </p>

          <p>
            The technical development of standards is not in scope for the Interest Group.
            Identified Recommendation Track opportunities will be handed over to appropriate W3C groups if such a group exists, or within a dedicated Community Group or Business Group when incubation is needed.

        <p>
          The primary deliverables of the WoT Interest Group are IG Notes that identify use cases and requirements for existing and/or new WoT building blocks (i.e., technical specifications).
          The IG Notes may contain the consensus of first implementation experiences gained by the group (e.g., during PlugFests).
          The group will also maintain a public list of identified WoT building blocks that it is tracking and investigating.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="communication">
        <h2>Communication</h2>

        <p id="public">Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public.</p>

        <p>Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group home page.</a></p>

        <p>Most Web of Things Interest Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>

        <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-wot-ig@w3.org">public-wot-ig@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-ig/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list.</p>

        <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and Members of the group, for Member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>
      </section>

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.
          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>Patent Disclosures</h2>
        <p>
          The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section 6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy.
          While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.
