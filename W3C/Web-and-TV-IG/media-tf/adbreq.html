	This document lists the design goals and requirements that
	HTML5 video, audio and media interfaces should support for Web
	and TV applications. Also this document includes links to
	several concrete proposals that are intended to meet the
	requirements developed by the Web and TV Interest Group
	participants.
        </section>

	<section id="sotd">
        The MPTF is a subset of the Web and TV Interest Group. The
	goal of MPTF is to discuss requirements placed on the HTML5
	video, audio and media interfaces by media formats that used
	for Web and TV applications.  The MPTF also proposes APIs that
	meet these requirements.

        The requirements and use cases in this document are the result
        of discussion within the Media Pipeline Task Force of the Web
        and TV Interest Group.  This document proposes additions to
        the HTML5 specification so that user agents can make bandwidth
        measurements and control adaptive streaming using a set of
        APIs in an interoperable way.

        This proposal extends the capability of HTML5's &lt;video&gt;
        and &lt;audio&gt; elements to allow JavaScript to generate
        media streams for playback. Allowing JavaScript to generate
        streams facilitates a variety of use cases like adaptive
        streaming and time shifting live streams.

        The Task Force believes all the requirements and use cases
        listed in this document will be next reviewd and discussed by
        the HTML Working Group for inclusion in the HTML
        specification.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A majority of Internet traffic is now streaming video.</p>

		<p>However, there are currently no standards or common conventions
			to provide commercial quality IP streaming video across different
			platforms and between unrelated companies.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Conformance</h2>

		<p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring
			guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
			non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

		<p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT in
			this specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
			[[RFC2119]].</p>

		<p>
			This specification only applies to one class of product:
			<dfn>W3C Technical Reports</dfn>
			. A number of specifications may be created to address the
			requirements enumerated in this document. In some cases the union of
			multiple parts of different specifications may be needed to address a
			single requirement. Nevertheless, this document speaks only of
			<dfn>conforming specifications</dfn>
			.
		</p>

		<p>Conforming specifications are ones that address one or more
			requirements listed in this document. Conforming specifications
			should attempt to address SHOULD level requirements requirements
			unless there is a technically valid reason not to do so.</p>

		<h2>Terminology</h2>

		<dl>
			<dt>
				<dfn>Adaptive Bit Rate</dfn>

			<dd>Adaptive bit rate media is characterized by short
				independent parallel media stream segments that can be individually
				selected and rendered according to some selective criteria.
				Typically, the parallel segments are differentiated by a feature
				such as required bandwidth, image resolution, etc.</dd>

			<dt>
				<dfn>Common Time Base</dfn>

		<h2>MPTF Requirements for Adaptive Bit Rate Streaming</h2>

		<p>This section list the requirements that conforming
			specification(s) would need to adopt in order to ensure a common
			interface and interpretation for the playback and control of adaptive
			bit rate media. These requirements are the result of an interactive
			process of feedback and discussion within the Media Pipeline Task
			Force of the Web and TV Interest Group</p>

		<section>
			<h3>General</h3>

			<section>
				<h4>Standards Compatibility</h4>
				<h5>Compatibility with widely deployed standards</h5>
				<p>One of the primary purposes for standardizing the way the
					media elements use adaptive bitrate streaming is to enable
					different existing and future adaptive bitrate streming methods to
					work consistently with HTML5 media tags. Therefore, media tags must
					work with the widely deployed adaptive bitrate methods that are
					available now.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Media Tags</h4>
				<h5>The &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags should be used to
					specify video and audio in HTML.</h5>
				<p>In the past, the &lt;obj&gt; tag has been used to add
					non-standard functionality to HTML pages. In order to provide more
					consistent functionality, the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;
					elements were added to HTML. This allows for consistent handling of
					streaming media between different browsers and encoded with
					different codecs. In order to maintain this consistency, any ABR
					solution must define how the video and audio elements can be used
					for playback of adaptive delivery format media.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Common Time Reference</h4>
				<h5>A common time reference must be unambiguously defined for
					combining tracks with different time references and for
					"continuous" tracks. Overlapping track segments must also be
					handled. (DASH may provide a reasonable model.)</h5>
				<p>Frequently, it is necessary to synchronize serveral different
					steaming content sources. For example, audio tracks must be
					synchronized with streaming video or the experience of watching the
					video becomes unpleasant. Synchronization is also important for
					advertising, closed caption and other streaming media features.
					Since different streaming media sources have different time
					references, a strategy for synchronizing these different references
					must be adopted.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Splicing</h4>
				<h5>It should be possible to seamlessly splice content with a
					discontinuous timeline (such as advertising) into the presentation.</h5>
				<p>In addition to a common time reference, mapping to that
					common time reference must be seamless enough to enable continuous
					playback from sources spliced relative to different time bases.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Trick Play</h4>
				<h5>Search and trick-play must be unambiguously defined in the
					context of this common time reference (e.g. anchor point and
					offset).</h5>
				<p>A common time reference is also important in the context of
					trick play. Pausing, advancing or rewinding media content must be
					done accurately and within a common reference. This is necessary in
					order to advance or rewind to exact locations or the adjust the
					playback lockation by precise increments.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Playability</h4>
				<h5>The ability of the user agent to play a piece of content
					must be determined quickly and with reasonable accuracy (e.g. using
					CanPlayType(codec, level, profile) or other means)</h5>
				<p>With media content available from sources around the world,
					it is important to quickly determine whether various content
					sources can be rendered. Therefore this determinitaion must be
					madew with a minimum of overhead.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>No ABR Method Preference</h4>
				<h5>The standard interface to support adaptive bit rate
					streaming must not advantage one specific ABR method over another.</h5>
				<p>HTML aspires to be a level playing field. This philosophy
					enables innovation to flourish and allows superior solutions to
					become quickly implemnted and adopted. ABR media systems are and
					should continue to be innovative solutions within this spirit of
					openness. Support for different ABR systems should not require any
					proprietary modification of the user agent</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Open Source Browsers</h4>
				<h5>The standard interface to support adaptive bit rate
					streaming must work with "open source" browsers.</h5>
				<p>The ability for a browser vendor to implement playback of ABR
					media in accordance with the requirements in this document must be
					supported.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Common Parameters</h4>
				<h5>Any parameters required for use of the ABR system must be
					identified and specifiable.</h5>
				<p>While specific implementations may include vendor-specific
					parameters for special features, the parameters required for basic
					playback should be publicly specified.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Common Errors</h4>
				<h5>Specific errors relevant to ABR media must be identified
					and reportable.</h5>
				<p>While specific implementations may include vendor-specific
					error codes, the error codes required for basic operation and
					diagnosis should be publicly specified. However, the particular ABR
					systems to be supported is an implementation decision.</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>

		<p>In the context of adaptive bit rate media, security is
			primarily concerned with ensuring that authorized users are able to
			play the media and unauthorized users are not. This may involve
			verifying that the content has been legally obtained. It may also
			mean that personally produced video is only viewable by friends and
			family. If viewing is intended to be restricted, a content protection
			system must be in place. Adaptive bit rate video should be treated
			the same as any video element in this regard. A content protection
			system for media elements has been proposed to the W3C HTML WG and is
			being reviewed. (Put reference here)</p>
