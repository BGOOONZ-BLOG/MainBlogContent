## (5 min) Wrap up & next steps

## Possible Takeaways

1. Everyone from BISG leaves the meeting with the goal of thoughtfully coming up with at least one accessibility standard 
   or technique which they feel either publishing as a whole or their publisher in particular doesn't know, understand, 
   or have the ability to implement.

2. By some date to be determined, via some communication method to be determined, those standards 
   or techniques will be communicated to DPUB Accessibility.

3. The Dpub accessibility team will go over that list.. Working with BISG people as necessary, 
   for each item on the list, we will determine a reason why we think it has been poorly communicated 
   to or understood by publishers.

4. Working with BISG people as necessary, for each item on the list, we will come up with one or two possible solutions 
   to the recognized problems.

5. We will communicate these concerns to the appropriate groups at the W3C.

6. After some period of time (a year?), both groups will sit down to hash out whether or not we think the process added value.
