<p>If you have information about browser compatibility of Web features — or are willing and able to do some research and/or experimentation — you can help update MDN’s <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/">Browser Compatibility Data</a> (BCD).</p>
<h2 id="where-does-it-need-to-be-done">Where does it need to be done?</h2>
<p>There are several ways that you can help improve browser compatibility information on MDN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add data for web features not yet included in the BCD repository</li>
<li>Update existing data with new information based on either changes to new versions of browsers, correcting mistakes in existing data, or updates to the features of a given technology</li>
<li>Submit pull requests to address <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues">BCD issues filed on Github</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-know-to-do-the-task">What do you need to know to do the task?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with using Github</li>
<li>Familiarity with using JSON</li>
<li>Information about, or ability to test for, compatibility of web standards features in different browsers. You can also convert “old” compatibility table data into JSON.</li>
</ul>

<p>For details on how to update the <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON">JSON</a> files that make up the BCD repository on Github, see our article on <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Compatibility_tables">compatibility tables</a>. For a list of issues that we’re specifically looking for help with, look for <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">Github issues with the “Help Wanted” tag</a>.</p>
