<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
The
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
suffers
from
a
lack
of
interoperability
across
platforms.
As
a
result
developers
are
faced
with
data
silos,
high
costs,
and
limited
market
potential.
This
can
be
likened
to
the
situation
before
the
Internet,
when
there
were
competing
non-interoperable
networking
technologies.
The
Internet
makes
it
easy
to
develop
networked
applications
independently
of
those
technologies.
The
W3C
is
seeking
to
do
the
same
for
the
Internet
of
Things
with
the
Web
of
Things.
</p>
<p>
To
achieve
this
goal
for
cross-platform
interoperability,
we
need
platform-independent
APIs
for
application
developers
and
a
means
for
different
platforms
to
discover
how
to
inter-operate
with
one
another.
The
approach
we
are
taking
is
based
upon
rich
metadata
that
describes
the
data
and
interaction
models
exposed
to
applications,
and
the
communications
and
security
requirements
for
platforms
to
communicate
effectively.
A
further
aspect
is
the
need
to
enable
platforms
to
share
the
same
meaning
when
they
exchange
data.
We
are
therefore
seeking
to
enable
expression
of
the
semantics
of
things
and
the
domain
constraints
associated
with
them,
building
upon
W3C's
extensive
work
on
RDF
and
Linked
Data.
This
is
the
second
charter
for
the
Web
of
Things
Interest
Group
and
continues
the
work
on
identifying
requirements
for
the
technology
building
blocks
for
the
application
layer
that
forms
the
Web
of
Things.
</p>
<p>
The
Web
of
Things
is
founded
on
the
<a href= "http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/">
Architecture
of
the
World
Wide
Web
</a>.
Things
stand
for
physical
or
abstract
entities
such
as
sensor
nodes
and
services
encompassing
multiple
devices,
respectively.
Each
thing
is
identified
with
a
URI.
This
URI
can
be
followed
to
access
the
thing's
description,
which
can
include
its
relationship
to
other
things,
analogous
to
links
in
HTML.
The
Web
of
Things
also
allows
for
on-device
data
processing
and
direct
thing-to-thing
interaction.
For
this,
things
can
provide
a
standardized
vendor
neutral
runtime
environment
for
portable
apps,
similar
to
Web
apps
running
in
every
browser.
Due
to
the
variations
in
requirements
across
application
domains,
there
are
many
protocols.
Things
can
be
interacted
with
on
many
kinds
of
platforms
and
devices
ranging
from
resource-constrained
IoT
devices
and
less
constrained
gateways
to
cloud-based
server
farms.
In
addition,
Web
browsers
may
be
used
for
the
human-machine
interface
for
services
based
around
the
Web
of
Things.
</p>
<p>
The
short
term
priority
for
the
Interest
Group
is
to
draft
a
proposed
charter
for
a
Working
Group
that
specifies
work
items
that
the
Interest
Group
believes
are
ready
for
progression
along
the
W3C
Recommendation
track.
In
the
mid-term,
the
priority
is
to
demonstrate
how
the
Web
of
Things
can
be
used
across
a
wide
range
of
IoT
platforms
in
collaboration
with
the
corresponding
consortia
and
organizations.
This
will
include
work
on
metadata
for
describing
particular
platforms,
as
well
as
work
on
semantic
models
and
constraints,
and
enabling
end-to-end
security
across
different
platforms.
In
the
long
term,
the
priority
will
be
on
enabling
open
markets
of
services
on
the
scale
of
the
Web.

</a>
The
Web
of
Things
Interest
Group
(WoT
IG)
is
a
forum
for
discussion
of
ideas
relating
to
the
Web
of
Things
and
is
intended
to
complement
the
role
of
the
proposed
Web
of
Things
Working
Group.
In
particular,
the
Interest
Group
will
propose
new
Work
Items
for
the
Working
Group
based
upon
new
use
case
considerations
and
discussions
with
IoT
developer
communities,
industry
alliances,
and
standards
development
organizations.
Vice
versa,
the
Interest
Group
will
consider
new
topics
that
are
submitted
to
it
by
the
Working
Group.
</p>
<p>
The
Interest
Group
will
identify
requirements
for
standardization
in
two
ways:
first,
by
exploring
use
cases
and
requirements
for
a
broad
range
of
application
domains,
and
second,
through
examining
the
requirements
for
integrating
a
broad
range
of
IoT
platforms
into
the
Web
of
Things.
Two
areas
that
have
already
been
identified
as
critical
are
semantic
interoperability
and
end-to-end
security
across
different
platforms.
The
Interest
Group
will
work
on
these
in
coordination
with
external
groups
to
address
their
needs.
</p>
<p>
In
the
mid
term,
this
is
expected
to
include
an
exploration
of
the
role
of
semantic
technologies
for
representing
and
applying
domain
constraints,
and
an
exploration
of
the
role
of
trust
assumptions
for
enabling
end-to-end
security
across
platforms
using
standards
defined
by
different
organizations.
This
work
would
combine
implementation
experience
with
in-depth
analysis.
The
Interest
Group
is
seeking
to
broaden
the
range
of
participants
to
provide
the
necessary
skills
and
resources
to
conduct
this
work.
</p>
<p>
An
important
activity
is
the
operation
of
PlugFests
to
collect
interoperability
implementation
experience
and
to
validate
the
current
working
assumptions
of
the
technological
building
blocks
discussed
in
the
Web
of
Things
Interest
Group
as
well
as
proposed
Working
Group.
These
events
enable
developers
to
get
together
to
test
their
implementations
and
facilitates
networking
between
partners
and
experts.
The
Interest
Group
will
seek
to
encourage
work
on
open
source
projects
and
community
evaluation
of
the
Web
of
Things.
In
more
detail,
PlugFests
allow
participants
to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
assist
with
preparing
implementation
reports
for
WoT
WG
Candidate
Recommendations
</li>
<li>
test-drive
upcoming
or
proposed
technologies
for
the
W3C
Recommendation
Track
</li>
<li>
take
part
in
interoperability
experiments
across
implementations
for
ideas
at
different
levels
of
maturity
</li>
<li>
reach
out
to
other
communities
and
new
Members
through
an
OpenDay
for
non-Members,
which
usually
includes
a
demo
track
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In
the
long
term,
the
Interest
Group
will
use
the
practical
experience
gained
from
these
experiments
as
a
basis
for
identifying
new
work
items.
Further
ideas
for
topic
areas
are
expected
from
discussions
and
expert
presentations
of
IoT
projects,
including
for
example,
decentralised
IoT
systems
and
the
role
of
blockchains.
Another
example
is
the
exploration
of
ideas
for
a
vendor
neutral
Web
platform
for
apps
that
are
installed
on
home
gateways.
The
Interest
Group
will
incubate
work
items
for
the
Web
of
Things
until
they
are
ready
for
transfer
to
the
W3C
Recommendation
Track,
either
in
existing
Working
Groups,
such
as
the
Web
of
Things
Working
Group,
or
in
new
working
groups.

</p>
<p>
This

primarily
conducts
its
technical
work
on
the
public
mailing
list
<a id="public-name" href= "mailto:public-wot-ig@w3.org">

The

is
invited

post

</p>
<p>
The

may
use
a
Member-confidential
mailing
list
for
administrative
purposes
and,
at
the
discretion
of

<h2>
Decision
Policy
</h2>
<p>
This
group
will
seek
to
make
decisions
through
consensus
and
due
process,
per
the
<a href= "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">
W3C
Process
Document
(section
3.3
</a>
).
Typically,
an
editor
or
other
participant
makes
an
initial
proposal,
which
is
then
refined
in
discussion
with
<del class="diff-old">Members
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">members
</ins>
of
the
group
and
other
reviewers,
and
consensus
emerges
with
little
formal
voting
being
required.
</p>
<p>
However,
if
a
decision
is
necessary
for
timely
<del class="diff-old">progress,
but
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">progress
and
</ins>
consensus
is
not
achieved
after
careful
consideration
of
the
range
of
views
presented,
the
Chairs
may
call
for
a
group
<del class="diff-old">vote,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">vote
</ins>
and
record
a
decision
along
with
any
objections.
</p>
<p>
To
afford
asynchronous
decisions
and
organizational
deliberation,
any
resolution
(including
publication
decisions)
taken
in
a
face-to-face
meeting
or
teleconference
will
be
considered
provisional.
A
call
for
consensus
(CfC)
will
be
issued
for
all
resolutions
(for
example,
via
email
and/or
web-based
survey),
with
a
response
period
from
one
week
to
10
working
days,
depending
on
the
chair's
evaluation
of
the
group
consensus
on
the
issue.
If
no
objections
are
raised
on
the
mailing
list
by
the
end
of
the
response
period,
the
resolution
will
be
considered
to
have
consensus
as
a
resolution
of
the
Interest
Group.
</p>
<p>
All
decisions
made
by
the
group
should
be
considered
resolved
unless
and
until
new
information
becomes
<del class="diff-old">available,
</del>
<ins class="diff-chg">available

or
unless
reopened
at
the
discretion
of
