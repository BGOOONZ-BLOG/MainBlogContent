	<h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This group will develop service specifications for exposing vehicle data and other information around vehicle centric functions.</p>
		<p>A common pattern will be described to unify the style the different service interfaces are using.</p>
		<p>The specification(s) produced by this Working Group will include security and privacy considerations.</p>
        <p>Members of the Working Group should review other working groups' deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working Group's mission.</p>
		<p>Services may include but are not limited to
			<ul>
				<li>Vehicle Data</li>
				<ul><li>vehicle brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, steering wheel position, tire pressure, oil level, wiper position, lights, doors, windows and seat settings as well as navigation, trip computer data, climate control data, speed, RPMs, acceleration, gears, &#8230;</li></ul>
				<li>media</li>
				<ul><li>media control, track lists, &#8230;</li></ul>

	              <p> This Working Group will not define or mandate implementation details
          including vehicle, network or sensor protocols for sharing data
          between the vehicle data network and sensors. The vehicle data bus
          network and protocols are OEM specific and vary from vehicle to
          vehicle.</p>
        <p>However, to facilitate interoperability among vehicle OEMs and
          encourage adoption of the specifications, the group may informatively reference
          existing suites of protocols, either directly in the
          deliverable(s) or in a non-normative companion Note.</p>

          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> for every feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
	<p>
	  Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/automotive/">Automotive Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
	<p>
	  Most Automotive Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
	<p>
	  This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-automotive@w3.org">public-automotive@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-automotive">archive</a>)
	  and on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/automotive">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
