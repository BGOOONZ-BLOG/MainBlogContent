				The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> (IG) is exploring and testdriving concepts and technologies to define WoT building blocks that appear ready for progression along the W3C Recommendation track.
        Furthermore, the IG is re-evaluating the current working assumptions of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Web of Things Working Group</a> (WG) based on "running code".
        The central mechanism for this are the W3C WoT PlugFests, where both Member and non-member implementors of WoT building blocks come together and test their solutions as well as demo their proposals.
        This document defines the scope and technical basis of the PlugFests.
        For this, it points to the (draft) specifications that apply, documents possible deltas that need to be realized, and defines which parts are mandatory, optional, or experimental to implement for the targeted PlugFest.
        Each PlugFest has its own release of this document.

				This document is an intermediary release of the current practices that are used at the Burlingame 2017 PlugFest of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a>.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>
        The IG operates in parallel to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">Web of Things Working Group</a> to explore new technologies and concepts, and to validate the current working assumptions.
        The latter is done buy testdriving implementations of the current draft specificiations in so-called PlugFests.
        This document defines the scope and technical basis of the Burlingame 2017 PlugFest.
        It assumes that the reader is familar with the basic concepts of W3C Web of Things and aware of the Working Group documents that specify the underlying WoT building blocks.
        The implementation target for the PlugFest is defined by referencing the underlying Working Draft version and stating the deltas (e.g., increments or optional experimental features) that need to be applied.
        Furthermore, it is defined, which parts are mandatory, optional, or experimental to implement.
			</p>
      
      <p>
        Note that there are different versions of the draft specifications out there:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Editor's Draft</b>:
            A snapshot version of the draft specification on github.io.
            It may change at anytime based on the activity of the editor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Working Draft</b>:
            A frozen release version of the draft specification that is copied on the w3.org Web server.
            It changes whenever the group publishes a new Working Draft version.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Latest published version</b>:
            A link under <code>w3.org/TR/...</code> to the most recent release on the w3.org Web server.
            It changes whenever the group publishes a new Working Draft version.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Specific version</b>:
            A specific release on the w3.org Web server identified through a date prefix such as <code>...-20170914</code>.
            These versions are fixed and archived on the w3.org Web server.
          </li>
        </ul>
        This document will always refer to such specific versions of the draft specifications.
      </p>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the following terms as defined by the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wot/architecture/wot-architecture.html">WoT Architecture</a> document.
        The WoT prefix is used to avoid ambiguity for terms that are defined specifically for Web of Things concepts.

			<h1>Burlingame 2017 Target</h1>
      
      <p>
        This section lists the different WoT building blocks that will be used in the PlugFest.
        For each, the PlugFest target is defined through a specified draft specification version and different deltas to be applied:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Reference Draft Specification</b>:
          a specific version of the corresponding Working Draft.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mandatory Deltas</b>:
          Must be implemented as diff from the reference draft specification.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Optional Deltas</b>:
          May be omitted from the reference draft specification.
          If implemented by a Thing, Things must ignore the deltas so that no impairment of the implemented features occurs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Experimental Deltas</b>:
          May be implemented on top of the reference draft specification including mandatory deltas.
          If not implemented, Things may react with errors.
          Thus, it is recommended to provide experimental deltas in implementations that are brought in addition to the main PlugFest implementations and to pair them with corresponding peers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Furthermore, this document provides samples and changelogs to enable a quick start for developers already familiar with the WoT building blocks and previous PlugFests.

        <section>
          <h3>Reference Draft Specification</h3>
          <p>
            The basis for the Thing Description (TD) implementation is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-wot-architecture-20170914/">Web of Things (WoT) Architecture</a> W3C First Public Working Draft 14 September 2017.

          <h3>Mandatory Delta</h3>
          <p>
            The WoT Architecture is generic about the discovery mechanism,
            as concrete solutions have been an IG activity so far.
            We will continue to use the same discovery mechanisms as in previous PlugFests.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h4>Manual Discovery</h4>
            <p>
              Manual discovery means that applications such as scripts for the WoT Scripting API are directly configured with the URI of the TD of the Thing to be consumed. For instance, this can be an <tt>http:</tt> URI for TD located on a Web server or a <tt>file:</tt> URI for locally stored TD (note that the WoT Runtime needs to be able to resolve file URIs).
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Directory Discovery</h4>
            <p>
              The W3C WoT IG is providing a Thing Directory under <a href="http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8081/">http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8081/</a>.
              Its source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-directory/">Github</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              PlugFest participants must be able to register the TDs of their Things at the Thing Directory.
              This can be done by the Thing implementation itself, a commissioning tool, or manually using a Web browser extension such as <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              An OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation of the Thing Directory can be found <a href="http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8081/api.json">here</a>.
              A textual documentation is available <a href="https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-directory#interacting-with-the-directory">here</a>.

        <h2>WoT Thing Description</h2>
        <p>
          The WoT Thing Description is the central WoT building block and must be provided if a Thing shall participate in the PlugFest.
          WoT Servers must provide their TD (directly or via external source such as a Web server or shared file).
          WoT Clients must be able to parse TDs and use the metadata correctly.

            <h4>JSON Schema Ontology</h4>
            <p>
              The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">Editor's Draft</a> of the WoT Thing Description defines a new <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#type-system">type system</a> that will be tested at the Burlingame PlugFest.
            </p>
            <p>
              The values of <code>inputData</code> and <code>outputData</code> are no longer verbatim JSON Schema, but a Linked Data version of the JSON Schema definitions. Please see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/#type-system">Section 6.5</a> of the Editor's Draft for details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simple types do not require any changes compared to previous JSON Schema.
            </p>
            <pre class="example" title="Simple Type Example">
              "outputData": {
                "type": "number",                    
                "minimum": 0,
                "maximum": 100
              }
            </pre>
            <pre class="example" title="Simple Type Sample on the Wire">
              42
            </pre>
            <p>
              Complex types now have a <code>fields</code> definition to avoid the naming conglict with Properties.
              The field element definitions are given in an array to be JSON-LD compatible.
            </p>
            <pre class="example" title="Complex Type Example">
              "outputData": {
                "type": "object",

            <h4>Security Metadata</h4>
            <p>
              The TD field <code>security</code> can provide access control and security configuration metadata.
              It is already defined as optional.
              In Burlingame, however, PlugFest participants are encouraged to include this field and propose their solutions for their requirements (e.g., OAuth, required proxies, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              Here as an example, JSON Web Token (JWT) type is assigned (cat),
              the corresponding hashing algorithm "HS256" (alg), and
              issuing authority of the security token (as).
            </p>
            <pre class="example">
              "security": {
                "cat":"token:jwt",
                "alg":"HS256",
                "as":"https://authority-issuing.example.org"
              }
            </pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Semantic Annotations</h4>
            <p>
              Semantic annotations are also optional by definitions.
              Again, Burlingame PlugFest participants are encouraged to include these annotations in their TDs.

          <section>
            <h4>Observable Properties</h4>
            <p>
              As per <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">Editor's Draft</a>, Property Interactions can now have a boolean <code>observable</code> flag.
              When set to true, WoT Clients can subscribe for change-of-value notifications, which need to be handled by the Protocol Bindings.
              A straight-forward candidate is CoAP Observe.
            </p>
            <pre class="example" title="Observable Property Example">
              {
                "@type": ["Property"],
                "name": "temperature",
                "outputData": { "type": "number" },
                "observable": true
              }

            <h4>Property Handler</h4>
            <p>
              The FPWD corrently defines the <code>ThingPropertyInit</code> without a handler for Property changes. Thus, a desired new state of the Property cannot be propagated within the Thing, e.g., to adjust local hardware accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>ThingPropertyInit</code> interface must be implemented as:
            </p>
            <pre class="idl">
              dictionary ThingPropertyInit {
                DOMString              name;
                boolean                writable = true;
                sequence<SemanticType> semanticTypes;
                ThingDescription       description;
                PropertyHandler        onWrite;
                any                    value;
              };
            </pre>
            <p>
              The <code>PropertyHandler</code> callback must take the old value and new value as arguments.
            </p>

            <h4><code>WoT.discover()</code> Method</h4>
            <p>
              The discovery implementation is not well documented yet.
              Thus, the <code>WoT.discover()</code> method may be omitted.
              Burlingame PlugFest participants are encouraged, however, to implement this to gain more experience.
              A possible starting point is the <code>local</code> discovery, where the WoT Runtime is expected to return all Things that are local to it.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4><code>ConsumedThing.observe()</code> Method</h4>
            <p>
              The <code>observe()</code> method is an alternative to the <code>addListener()</code>/<code>removeListener()</code> methods.
              It may be omitted by PlugFest implementations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If present, the <code>observe()</code> method expects a <code>RequestType</code> argument that assumes mechanisms that are not provided by Things (e.g., remote notifications when a Property is read or an Action invoked).
              This argument may be ignored, so that <code>observe()</code> only takes the name of the Interaction to be observed.
              This can either be an Observable Property or an Event.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Events</h4>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-wot-scripting-api-20170914/#events">Section 4.9</a> of the FPWD defines type that are not compatible with the Thing Description model.
              All definitions may and are recommended to be omitted by PlugFest implementations.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4><code>RequestHandler</code> API</h4>
            <p>
              The FPWD introduced an alternative API that works more like a REST framework and exposes low-level <code>Request</code> objects to the script.
              All related specifications may be omitted by PlugFest implementations.

        <p>The security mechanisms in this section describe how to to establish the authorization and the authentication of WoT interactions for the following components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <b>Resource server</b> (RS) responding to requests via HTTP or CoAP</li>
          <li>A <b>Client</b> (C) sending requests via HTTP or CoAP</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Note that adding security is regarded to be optional. Moreover, the mechanisms currently described provide basic protection of the interactions. Doing so is intentional to offer a <i>low entry-barrier</i> to encourage many security-enabled PlugFest implementations. For that purpose it is fully intentional to take various shortcuts. For production use additional considerations and additional security mechanisms/checks will typically be required.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The architectural security model adopted from IETF ACE define also the following components:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An <b>Authorization Manager</b> (AM) representing multiple clients</li>
          <li>An <b>Authorization Server</b> (AS) representing multiple resource servers</li>
        </ul>

          
        <p>For a security-enabled PlugFest implementation <a href="#simple-request-authorization-and-caller-authentication"><i>Request Authorization and Caller Authentication</i></a> is considered to be the primary goal while <a href="#message-authentication-and-encryption"><i>Message Authentication and Encryption</i></a> represents a subordinate security goal for now.</p>
        
        <p class="ednote">
          We would like to point out that the technical details are the same as in previous PlugFests (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/images/0/0c/Security_4_Plugfest_%E2%80%93_HowTo.pdf" >HowTo description</a> from Nice PlugFest). That said, this is also the reason that some <i>identifiers</i> and <i>names</i> relate to Nice (e.g., <code> NicePlugfestRS</code> or <code>NicePlugfestAS</code>).
        </p>
          
        <section>
          <h4><i>Simple</i> Request Authorization and Caller Authentication</h4>
          <p>The goal is to authorize requests and (implicitly) authenticate callers by means of bearer security token (JWT, see [[!RFC7519]]) with minimal contents.</p>
          <p class="issue">For the protection of high-value resources, PoP  respectively HoK models may be required instead of bearer tokens.</p>

			<h1>Security Considerations</h1>

      <p>
        Things brought to the PlugFest location can be unprotected prototypes.
        The PlugFest network is behind a NAT and continuous monitoring can be assumed.
			</p>
      
      <p>
        Things and gateways deployed in the cloud to testdrive connectivity and synchronization of Servients should be hardened against attacks.
        The simplest way is to isolate them from actual infrastructure, only start them during the PlugFest hours, and monitor them during this time.
        When running them for a longer time (e.g., providing them already for pre-testing), the instances should be hardened through the usual Web security features such as TLS and an access control mechanism.

				<h2>Participation Howto</h2>

				<p class="note" title="Status">
					The current status of the howto is <a href="#plugfest-duesseldorf-2017">D&uuml;sseldorf (2017-07)</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					This howto is kept up to date with the requirements for the latest/upcoming edition of the PlugFest.
					To participate in an upcoming PlugFest, prepare an implemention by deciding on the following questions.
					The answers to these questions will also be needed when registering for a PlugFest by filling out a table in the corresponding PlugFest page in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Main_Page#Face_to_Face_Meetings">WoT IG Wiki</a>.
					Note that there might be additional options in the future when more features are defined or more <a>Protocol Bindings</a> become popular in the PlugFest.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3>What to Implement?</h3>

					<ol>
						<li>
							WoT Client (e.g., a Web dashboard)
							<blockquote>
								A WoT client implementation requires a <a>TD</a> parser and a user interface or control logic to drive the interaction with one or more other <a>Things</a>.
								Optionally, it can implement lookup support for the <a>Repository</a> (also see <a href="#repository">3.2.6.2.2 Repository</a>. An HowTo how such a lookup can be realised can be found <a href="https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-repository#returns-a-list-of-tds-based-on-a-sparql-query-pattern-eg-a-client-queries-the-repository-for-a-td-with-a-specific-thing-uri" target="_blank">here</a>. 
								For the TD parser, a <a>JSON-LD</a> library is recommended, but it is also possible to implement a simpler parser that exploits knowledge about which parts of the TD are actually relevant for the Thing.
								Simple WoT clients can have a limited notion of the semantics and only support interactions that match their own capabilities.
								A simple switch, for instance, does not need to understand the RGB color model.
								Powerful WoT clients, however, may have full RDF support and require access to Linked Data to reason about the metadata and interactions provided by the TD.
							</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							WoT Server (e.g., a Thing that only provides functionality, but does not use other Things)
							<blockquote>
								A WoT server requires resource handlers that implement Properties, Actions, or Events.
								The <a>TD</a> can vary between static or dynamically generated based on the implementd interactions.
								For this, a simple JSON library is enough, as the vocabulary is fully known at design time.
								A WoT server should also implement support for TD Repository registration. A registration HowTo can be found <a href="https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-repository#interacting-with-a-thingweb-repository-server" target="_blank">here</a>.
							</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							WoT Servient (e.g., a virtual Thing that composes multiple other Things and provides a higher-level TD)
							<blockquote>
								A WoT <a>servient</a> is capable of thing-to-thing interaction.
								It needs to implement both server and client requirements.
								The server part is usually used to configure the Thing, so it knows which interaction to select on the other Thing(s).
								A powerful Thing might only need rough information such as all Things at location X and then uses semantic match between itself and the capabilities of the discovered Things.
								A smart switch, for instance, has the notion of being on or off, and hence binds to the first <code>onOffStatus</code> interaction it finds on discovered lamps.
								Resource-constrained Things usually need the exact wiring configuration by a user or comissioning tool.
								A smartphone app, for instance, can be used to write the TD of a specific lamp together with the <code>@id</code> value of the desired interaction to the configuration Properties of a energy-harvesting switch.
								The client part then starts the interaction with the other Thing(s) by constructing messages based on the given TD and implemented <a>Protocol Bindings</a>.
							</blockquote>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Which Protocols to Support?</h3>

					<ol>
						<li>
							HTTP
							<blockquote>
								The classic Web protocol is currently most common for clients (e.g., with a Web UI) and more powerful Things.
								There is a plethory of HTTP frameworks available for most languages and platforms.
							</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							CoAP
							<blockquote>
								This protocol is predominant for resource-constrained Things.
								Several different CoAP implementations and frameworks can be found <a href="http://coap.technology/impls.html">here</a>.
							</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							Additional Protocols
							<blockquote>
								To evaluate more <a>Protocol Bindings</a>, implementors are welcome to bring Things with alternative protocol stacks to the PlugFests.
								Some protocols might require a shim layer to allow for the resource model of WoT.
							</blockquote>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What Security Modes to Support?</h3>

					<ol>
						<li>NoSec (there is no security involved)</li>
						<li>
							Request authorization (i.e., using JSON Web Tokens (JWT))
							<ol>
								<li>Simple (i.e., bearer security token only)</li>
								<li>Advanced (i.e., token with access control information in style of AIF [draft-bormann-core-ace-aif-03])</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Message authentication and encryption (i.e., using (D)TLS)</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>How to Implement the Application Logic?</h3>

					<ol>
						<li>
							Native Code</li>
							<blockquote>
								The application logic is implemented directly in the firmware or a supported language of the protocol framework.
								This is the default for resource-constrained Things that serve a specific purpose.
							</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							Scripting
							<blockquote>
								Having the application logic in scripted apps means that the servient must implement a runtime environment that provides the <a>Scripting API</a>.
								Node.js may provide a good initial prototype for a WoT runtime environment on more powerful Things or cloud servients.

				<h2>Sapporo (2015-10)</h2>

				<p>This first WoT PlugFest elaborated, based on a JSON-LD Thing Description, server and client role of a Thing.
				   Protocols such as CoAP, HTTP and WebSocket were combined with JSON and EXI data formats.</p>
				<p>More information can be found on the dedicated <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting_29-30_October_2015,_Sapporo,_Japan#Plugfest">wiki</a> page.</p>
				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Interoperable applications by means of a Thing Description only</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Outcome &amp; Findings</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Thing description registry and discovery is needed</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Nice (2016-01)</h2>

				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>Based on the previous <a href="#sapporo-2015-10">PlugFest in Sapporo</a> four advances will be proposed
				   (more information can be found on the dedicated <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting_2016,_January,_26th_%E2%80%93_28th,_France,_Nice#PlugFest">wiki</a> page).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Security: using new security mechanisms that emerged for protecting new styles of Web applications (Web/REST APIs, browser-based/mobile apps) in the Things space</li>
					<li>APIs: generic APIs to program behavior for a Thing or interact with a Thing</li>
					<li>Thing registries: practical registration and discovery of a Thing</li>
					<li>HATEOAS: application of REST-based hypermedia controls in the Thing world</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Outcome &amp; Findings</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Thing Description
						<ul>
							<li>Protocols: how to set up IP addresses?</li>
							<li>How to setup data types with restrictions, e.g. with ranges?</li>
							<li>Security: Which resources has access restrictions?</li>
							<li>How to deal with the situation a Thing changes its capabilities?</li>
							<li>How to share interactions of a TD across several Things?</li>
							<li>De-coupling: semantics / relation types from links</li>
							<li>REST-based topics:
								<ul>
									<li>Resource hierarchy missing (no parentOf and/or childOf)</li>
									<li>Relative links vs. absolute links in interaction models </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>How to include more semantics / other context</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Scripting API
						<ul>
							<li>"Server"-side API is missing and needs to be added</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Security Findings (details can be found <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/images/1/18/Security%26Privacy_-_Plugfest_Findings_and_Implementers_Feedback.pdf">here</a>)
						<ul>
							<li>The security token form-factor CWT was unavailable due to lack of signature/encryption support in current CBOR libraries</li>
							<li>The security token form-factor JWT is versatile but lacks a standard way of  distinguishing different types</li>
							<li>CoAP lacks adaptation of the HTTP authorization framework (RFCs 2617/7235)</li>
							<li>CoAP stacks lack programmatic/declarative ways of telling the runtime to enforce the presence of valid security tokens (for certain resources)</li>
							<li>WoT lacks consideration on whether that should be expressed in Thing Descriptions (opt. item for domains that prefer a-priori strategies)</li>
							<li>OAuth resp. ACE miss some coverage for cross-domain cases</li>
						</ul>

				the dedicated <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting_2016,_April,_11th_-_13th,_Montreal,_Canada#PlugFest">WoT Montreal PlugFest wiki page</a>.</p>
				<p>With this PlugFest we would like to move on from testing the practices in this document to actually
				   accomplishing real-world scenarios.</p>
				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>Compared to previous PlugFests we do not plan to introduce new technologies nor additional parts.
				   Instead we focus on a broader support of the same features by different implementations.</p>
				<p>Moreover, we especially encourage real-world scenarios in the following two areas:<p/>
				<ul>
					<li>Thing-to-thing communication and interactions</li>
					<li><a href="#scripting-api">Scripting API</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Former PlugFest participants are well aware of the available actuation and sensing capabilities of Things.
				   That said, we would like to stimulate new scenarios based on what we have seen so far
				   (e.g., discover Properties and combine them with Actions and/or Events of other Things). Feel free
				   to come up with rather sophisticated real-world use-cases.
				   Please also make use of the discovery to improve PlugFest preperation and enable onsite combination of Things.</p>
				<p>It is time to stress what we elaborated so far to actually proof it!</p>
				<h3>Outcome &amp; Findings</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>TBD</li>
