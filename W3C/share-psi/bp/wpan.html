<section id="outline"><h2>Outline</h2>
<p>Establishing and Managing a National Public Actors Network on Open Data to cooperate in solving common problems and challenges.</p>
</section>


<section id="ms"><h2>Management Summary</h2>
<p>Many French local authorities (cities, metropolitan areas, departments, regions) have opened their data since early 2010. They felt the need to join forces in a network that:</p><ul>
<li>brings together Communities through sharing and communication tools;</li>
<li>promotes procedures (best practices) between the members;</li>
<li>mutualises actions like data normalization or legal articles writing;</li>
<li>officially represents the members from public national bodies or private actors;</li>
<li>develops collective projects at national or international level.</li></ul>
<p>Through this network, called <a href="http://www.opendatafrance.net/">OpenDataFrance</a>, local governments have a spokesperson, a development tool and an effective communication channel.</p>
<section id="challenge"><h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>Driven by various associations such as the new generation Internet Foundation (<a href="http://www.fing.org/">Fing</a>) or LiberTIC, the Open Data movement in France started in 2010. Local authorities in Rennes, followed by the city of Paris and Montpellier, and a dozen more cities in 2011 began to open their data. In early 2012, the twenty communities met and realised that they had the same problems and the same challenges: standardise, facilitate, communicate, etc.</p>
</section>

<section id="solution"><h3>Solution</h3><ul>
<li>Establishment of an association (NGO) in 2012 with statutes, missions and objectives, governance and budget model.</li>
<li>Development of the network of actors represented by<ul>
  <li>local politicians ( for legitimacy);</li>
  <li>operational agents in these territories.</li></ul></li>
<li>Set-up of communication tools (e.g. Website, Social Networks, Scoop -it, Document sharing tools, Mailing list, collaboration tools).</li>
<li>Network management by a core team.</li>
<li>Intervention in conferences, hearings or working groups.</li>
<li>Production of documentation (Communication Pack, Certification Pack, Standardisation Pack, Legal Pack, Animation Pack etc.)</li></ul>

<section id="bpi"><h2>Best Practice Identification</h2>
<section id="why"><h3>Why is this a Best Practice? What’s the impact of the Best Practice</h3><ul>
<li>Bringing a real added value to the development of Open Data in France and helps many communities to enter the Open Data movement or improve it.</li>
<li>Creating savings in terms of time spent (not reinvent what already exists, not to make twice or more the same work) and time to completion (shorter, safer). </li>
<li>Enabling collaboration, it helps to quickly share positive and negative experiences of each other to go straight to the target and to improve incrementally best practices.</li>

<section id="whyNeed"><h3>Why is there a need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Speed, scale economy, cooperation, pragmatic and incremental approach.</li>
<li>Leverage on other actors (stronger decisions by cooperation).</li></ul>
</section>

<section id="whatNeed"><h3>What do you need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<p>Human Resources:</p><ul>
  <li>design and animation: 20 days of set-up + 8 days/months of community management;
  <li>cost: free (light part-time of few agents in local administrations.</li></ul>
<p>An expenditure of around €40K/year (2014 prices) should cover:<p><ul>
  <li>Hosting of digital tools (server for the site, files and mail &hellip;)</li>
  <li>Purchase and maintenance of hardware and software (webserver).</li>
  <li>Travel and reception (cocktail, drinks).</li>
  <li>Communication costs (printing flyers, poster or documentation).</li>
  <li>Specific services (legal advice, accouting).</li></ul>
<p>The association can charge some services to public customers through ad-hoc agreements.</p>
