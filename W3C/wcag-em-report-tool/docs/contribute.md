# Get involved with the WCAG-EM Report Tool

The WCAG-EM Report Tool is an open source project that came out of the [WAI-ACT project](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ACT/). It is currently maintained by volunteers for the W3C. And we would love to have you involved.

There are multiple ways in which you can contribute to the project, here are a few: 

- Report issues
- Create a translation
- Contribute code


## Report Issues
We work hard to keep the code quality at a high level. But we're human, so we make mistakes too. Found any of them? By all means let us know so we can correct them. You can do so by creating an issue on our [issues page](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool/issues). If you report an issue, please check if it isn't already reported.


## Create A Translation
Do you feel the WCAG-EM Report Tool should be available in a different language? Well, we do too! Even better, if you have some time to contribute and share it with the community. For more information, read our [translation instructions](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool/blob/master/docs/translation.md)


## Contribute Code
Have an idea for a feature and have some time to develop it? Let us know! We'll gladly have new contributors to the project. We'll help you figure out the best way to fit it into the project, and work with you so the changes you make fit into the overall project.

For minor feature changes, [creating a pull request](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool/pulls) once it is finished is sufficient. But for larger changes, please create an issue first to discuss how to fit it into the larger project.

For more detail on how the project is set up, read the [developer documentation](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool/blob/master/docs/developer-docs.md).
