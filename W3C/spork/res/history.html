  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a
  number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.</p>

  <p>With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt
  at extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as
  HTML 3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML4 quickly followed later that same year.</p>

  <p>The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on
  an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. <!-- http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/future/#summary --> This
  effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML, known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new
  features except the new serialization, and which was completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C's
  focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of
  XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not
  compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML2.</p>

  <p>Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed
  by browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level
  2 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then petered
  out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed
  before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.</p>

  <p>In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of
  Web forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements
  for it. This interest was borne from the realization that XML's deployment as a Web technology was
  limited to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for
  existing deployed technologies (like HTML).</p>

  <p>A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4's forms to provide many of the
  features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines
  that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed
  interest. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was
  already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's
  copyright.</p>

  <p>The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where
  some of the principles that underlie the HTML5 work (described below), as well as the
  aforementioned early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the
  W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal
  conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web's evolution; the W3C staff and
  membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue
  working on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list
  was created, and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to
  be jointly owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.</p>

  <p>The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be
  backwards compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means
  changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be
  detailed enough that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without
  reverse-engineering each other.</p>

  <p>The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML5 specification include
  what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML. It
  also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 after all,
  and in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the
  HTML5 specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under
  the W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG
  site.</p>

  <p>For a number of years, both groups then worked together under the same editor: Ian Hickson.
  In 2011, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to
  draw a line in the sand for features for a HTML5 Recommendation, while the WHATWG wanted to
  continue working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification
  and adding new features. In mid 2012, a new editing team was introduced at the W3C to take
  care of creating a HTML5 Recommendation and prepare a Working Draft for the next HTML
  version. In 2014 HTML5 went to Recommendation.</p>

  <p>A separate document is published to document the differences between the HTML specified
  in this document and the language described in the HTML4 specification.
