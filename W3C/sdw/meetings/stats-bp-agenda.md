# Statistics on the Web Best Practices - Agenda 20 Feb 2018

## Objectives and scope

* 'on the web'
* relation to spatial data
* 'statistics': government, scientific, other?

Define clearly what we are aiming to achieve

## Existing work to consider

* How does this initiative differ from existing standards or best practices for statistics?
* Are we taking sufficient account of existing work? (avoid re-inventing wheel, ensure acceptance from a broad community)
* How do we ensure we get sufficient input from relevant communities?

Examples of existing work related to statistics:
* RDF Data Cube
* SDMX
* OGC Observations and Measurements
* [SSN/SOSA](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn)
* United Nations [GGIM](http://ggim.un.org/meetings/GGIM-committee/documents/GGIM6/Background-Paper-Proposal-for-a-global-statistical-geospatial-framework.pdf)
* [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/dime-directors-methodology_en)
* Australian Bureau of Statistics: [Statistical Spatial Framework](http://www.nss.gov.au/nss/home.nsf/pages/Statistical%20Spatial%20Framework%20Overview)
* others?

Other related standards and best practices
* SDWBP
* DWBP
* Dataset Exchange Working Group

## Work programme

* [Outline schedule](https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/stats-bp/work-plan.md)
* Currently working on use cases
* Process to develop best practices doc - lessons learned from SDWBP?
* Best practice: what people are doing vs what people should be doing?

## Draft use cases

Review [current working document](https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/stats-bp/draft-use-case-list.md)

* Do we have enough use cases?
* How to solicit more?
* Style of use cases - how much detail, how specific vs generic?
