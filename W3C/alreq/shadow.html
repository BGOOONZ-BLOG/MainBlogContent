          one-half, say, 2/1 or ٢/١, mostly in RTL mode. There is no standard approach, however,

<div class="issue question">
  <ul>
          <li>In Urdu words are not necessarily bounded by spaces. What method is used for

          <li>What are the rules for hyphenation in Arabic script text?</li>


          <li>The CSS Text spec <a href=

          such as Arabic are allowed to break within words due to hyphenation, the characters must
          still be shaped as if the word were not broken." The example shows Uighur text with a
          hyphen at the end of a line and with shaped characters at line end and start. Is this
          normal in Arabic and Persian text also?
          </li>


          <li>In some styles of CJK typesetting, English words are allowed to break between any two
          letters, rather than only at spaces or hyphenation points. Are the rules different form
          Arabic script text?</li>


          <li>The CSS spec <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#word-break-property">says</a>

            hanging-punctuation</a> property allows the arabic comma and arabic full stop to hang

          <li>What should happen if an application uses a Ruqʻah font as a fallback, which cannot
          allow for word elongation? Does the application need to automatically know that it should
          not stretch words when using this font style?</li>


          <li>How does an application or person decide which methods to use, and where, to justify
          text?</li>


          <li>The CSS Text spec says: that, apart from elongation, applications "must assume that
          no justification opportunity exists between any pair of typographic letter units in
          cursive script (regardless of whether they join). " Is this correct? InDesign, for
