    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is a key aspect of W3C's commitment to a Web for All. W3C standards include accessibility guidelines and technical specifications. However, accessibility is not as widely known and understood as many areas of W3C work. Understanding and implementing W3C's accessibility standards is quite complex. The Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group addresses these challenges and <span class="listintro">supports W3C's mission by</span>: </p>
    <ul class="listafterp listspaced">
      <li><strong>Promoting W3C standards and resources for accessibility</strong>: Maintaining and extending the broad recognition of W3C standards and resources for accessibility, to further strengthen the credibility, authority, and trust in W3C as the leading technical body for web accessibility. </li>
      <li><strong>Supporting uniform uptake of W3C standards for accessibility</strong>: Contributing to harmonized adoption of W3C standards in national and international standardization efforts (e.g. US Section 508, European EN 301 549, etc.), to enable organizations to use W3C standards and supporting educational, technical, and evaluation resources across multiple international markets.</li>
      <li><strong>Supporting implementation of W3C standards for accessibility</strong>: Assisting a broad audience (developers, designers, project managers, etc.), including W3C membership, in understanding and implementing W3C standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Engaging the community around W3C standards and resources</strong>: Engaging a wide multi-stakeholder community (industry, experts, researchers, users, etc.), throughout the development of W3C standards and resources, to improve the quality, consensus, and acceptance. </li>
      <li><strong>Demonstrating W3C leadership in building a better web</strong>: Reinforcing the leadership of W3C as the go-to standardization body for web standards, to support the mission of leading the web to its full potential and to promote the universality of the web.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="listintro">EOWG resources have proven valuable to promoting understanding, implementing, and testing conformance to W3C accessibility standards. The community relies on authoritative support from EOWG resources, for example:</p>
    <ul class="listafterp">
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/">Web Accessibility Tutorials</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary">Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility</a></li>

      <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspectives/">Web Accessibility Perspectives – Videos that Explore the Impact and Benefits for Everyone</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p> This charter proposes continuing the Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group to maintain continuity of established W3C Member engagement in successfully developing deliverables consistent with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#GAGeneral">W3C Process definition of a Working Group</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="participation"> Participation </h2>
    <p> To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration.  Chairs and resource Editors are expected to contribute at least 6 hours per week towards the Working Group. Active participants are expected to contribute about 4 hours per week.</p>
    <p> The group encourages W3C Member and public questions, comments, and issues on its document repositories and  public mailing lists, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.</p>
    <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
      W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="communication">
    <h2> Communication </h2>
    <p id="public"> Content discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editors' Drafts will be developed in a public repository and will permit direct public contribution requests.
      The teleconferences  are not open to public participation.</p>
    <p> Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO">Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group home page</a>.</p>
    <p> This group primarily conducts its  work through teleconferences, <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/wai-eo/repositories">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35532/all">surveys</a>;  and occasionally uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/EOWG_Meetings">wiki</a> and the e-mail list w3c-wai-eo@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/">archive</a>) for communication. The public is invited to review, discuss, and contribute to this work.</p>
    <p> The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="decisions">
    <h2> Decision Policy </h2>
    <p> This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with the group participants and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
    <p> However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.  To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
      
      A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey).
      
    If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.  All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director. </p>
    <p> This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>

  <section id="patentpolicy">
    <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
    <p>The Working Group provides an opportunity to
      share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
      Working Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
      disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
      6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Working Group does not
      produce Recommendation-track documents, when Working Group
      participants review Recommendation-track specifications from other Working
      Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
      please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C
      Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>
