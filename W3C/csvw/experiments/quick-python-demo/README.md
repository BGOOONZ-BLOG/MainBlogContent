# Python demo

Warning: do not mistake this for a real implementation.

This Python script generates RDF from CSV based on a JSON file. It 
makes many assumptions that are unwarranted simplifications. The 
file _output.nt contains sample output.

Example is taken from http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-csv2rdf-20150716/#example-events-listing
