<p>{{APIRef(“WebRTC”)}}</p>
<p>The <strong><code>sliCount</code></strong> property of the {{domxref(“RTCRtpStreamStats”)}} dictionary indicates how many <strong>Slice Loss Indication</strong> (<strong>SLI</strong>) packets were received by the sender.</p>
<p>An SLI packet is used by a decoder to let the encoder know that it’s detected corruption of one or more consecutive macroblocks in the received media.</p>

<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>An unsigned long integer indicating the number of SLI packets the sender received from the receiver due to lost runs of macroblocks. A high value of <code>sliCount</code> may be an indication of an unreliable network.</p>
<p>For technical details, see {{RFC(4585, “6.3.2”)}}.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This value is sent by the sender to the receiver and is only present for video media.</p>
