# Instructions for using the "projects" tab

The "projects" tab is used to keep track of what we're working on.
The way we use it is:
- Each editor, when he starts working on an issue, moves it to the "in progress" column. He should not have more than one there.
- When the PR to address the issue is done, he moves it to the "Awaiting review" column.
- When the PR is merged, the issue is closed, and it goes to "Done".
- At the Thursday meeting, we try to empty the "Awaiting review" column - things either get merged and moved to "Done", or critiqued and go back to "In progress".
- At the Thursday meeting, we ask each editor about the status of the issue in the "in progress" column. If the editor isn't actively working on it, it goes back to the "To do" column.
- When closed, the issue goes to the "Done" column. (This is automated.)

PRs aren't tracked in the project, just issues. If an issue doesn't need to be addressed in order to get to PR, remove it from the project, label it "icebox", and consider just closing it.

The point of the project tracking, on top of the other tracking, is just to focus the editors' collective minds on what is currently being worked on, knowing that the rest aren't being worked on at the moment.
