# The W3C Web Payments Interest Group

The mission of the [Web Payments Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/blog/wpig/), 
part of the [Web Payments Activity](https://www.w3.org/Payments/), 
is to provide a forum for Web Payments technical discussions to identify 
use cases and requirements for existing and/or new specifications to ease 
payments on the Web for users (payers) and merchants (payees), and to 
establish a common ground for payment service providers on the Web Platform. 

The overall objective of this group is to identify and leverage the conditions 
for greater uptake and wider use of Web Payments through the identification of 
standardization needs to increase interoperability between the different 
stakeholders and the different payment methods.
