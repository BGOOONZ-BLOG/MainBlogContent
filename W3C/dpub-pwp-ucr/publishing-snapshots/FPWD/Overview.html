    <p>The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within domains and with explicit navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites. This model inherited very little from an existing, powerful and much older page-based media: books.</p>

    <p>Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines, pamphlets of long-form articles and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics, notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media, made public.</p>

    <p>We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition of portable, bounded publications with the pervasive accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New models of economic sustainability, innovative experiences of knowledge and invigorated socio-cultural engagement depend on this.</p>

    <p>It is the task of this <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Digital Publishing Interest Group to explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing these two great models of publishing together. This document explores requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios. The fundamental, baseline requirements that form the heart of what is expected from a PWP are described first, followed by requirements and use cases that describe additional, strongly desired scenarios. The complete list of requirements is also collected in a separate table in

      <p>
        The terms “online” and “offline” are used in this document, but the borderline between these is not always clear cut. For example, a PWP can be on a local disc but accessed through a web server running on that machine (i.e., through a <code>http://localhost</code> URL). The behavior of the client in this case is identical to the situation when the publication is genuinely online, although, technically, the publication is clearly offline. Similarly, a remote file system can be mounted as a local disc, in which case a PWP can be accessed as a file though technically online. A more precise terminology would use the terms like “protocol” and “file” states, for what is colloquially called “online” and “offline” in this document.

      <p class="req" id="r_owp"><a href="#r_owp">Req. 2</a>: PWPs should be able to make use of all facilities offered by the OWP.</p>

      <p>There is a formidable development of visualization systems, interactive tools, and other powerful facilities that are built on top of the OWP, including accessing external services like Wolfram Alfa. These tools have been traditionally developed for browsers, and provide possibilities that traditional publications, such as books, magazines, scholarly papers, and educational materials, should also benefit from. That requires publications to become first class citizens on the web platforms. </p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>A large, multidisciplinary, web-based journal relies on traditional web technologies like HTML and CSS for its content. The journal, responding to the evolving expectations of its audience, is increasingly using additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, and very large images; the trend is to consider these as integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a result needs access to the latest visualization and other data management tools that the OWP-based tools can offer.

The quantity of documentation makes it impractical to produce these documents in print. Instead, the company publishes them on the company intranet, and/or provides them to their employees and contractors via specialized mobile devices. The production of these documents has similar challenges to scholarly publications including issues around accessibility, portability of annotations, and the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

      <p>Preserving essential content is the job of the reading system. However, having a clear indication within the publication format to mark which items are critical, and which instead need a fallback for limited connectivity/storage situations, would provide critical input to the reading system to do it's job. This would also give more control to the publisher, allowing them to ensure a consistent user experience while consuming the publication. When changing the state of a PWP from, e.g., online to offline, an implementation knows which PWP resources are essential for the display of the content, and therefore must be included in the offline version, or which may be skipped (see <a class="sec-ref" href="#fundamental-online-offline"><span class="secno">2.4</span> <span class="sec-title">Online and Offline</span></a> and <a class="sec-ref" href="#fundamental-transition"><span class="secno">2.5</span> <span class="sec-title">State Transitions</span></a>)</p>

      <p>Non-essential content, which is not required to be available in certain states, should have a predefined fallback that will allow the user to continue consumption (even in a potentially degraded, but author-controlled manner) (see also <a class="sec-ref" href="#states"><span class="secno">4.</span> <span class="sec-title">States of a PWP</span></a>).</p>

Nick is also a multi-device user who wishes to consume the publication on multiple devices. Some of those devices have limited storage, and some of them have limited connectivity. Nick also rides the subway, where he loses Internet connectivity frequently and without warning for long stretches of time. During offline or low-storage situations, there are still critical parts of the publication that are consumable, mainly the text (and possibly images).

      <p class="req" id="r_horizdep"><a href="#r_horizdep">Req. 14</a>: The publication should conform to all the requirements of horizontal dependencies.</p>

      <p>Web content has to be consumed under different circumstances: it must be available to the largest possible audience in a secure manner, providing the necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication content must be able to answer to a number of principles like accessibility, internationalization, device independence, security, or privacy. (These are usually referred to, in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> context, as “horizontal” dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>(Web) Accessibility:</dt>
        <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access the content; they should be able to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the content, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.</dd>

        <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
        <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language, writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left, horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>

        <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
        <dd>Content should be usable on a large number of devices with very different device characteristics: different screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying level of processing power, etc. These different affordances should be automatic with no, or very little user intervention.</dd>

        <dt>Security:</dt>
        <dd>Publications should prevent malicious attacks, data theft, and other security incidents, even if they contain secure mashups, access to distributed services, etc. Consuming the content should not jeopardize the integrity of the underlying data, users’ privacy, or machine operations.</dd>

        <dt>Privacy:</dt>
        <dd>Content should maintain and support user privacy, in spite of the fact that the evolution of online technologies has increased the possibility for the collection and processing of personal, and possibly sensitive, data, as well as the ability to ubiquitously track a user's online activity.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible extension for PWP) insofar as the technologies must empower the authors (writers, editors, publishers, etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether authors use the possibilities of these technologies or not is not addressed in this document.</p>

      <p>All these constraints are usually formalized in the context of the usage on the Web, but they are also valid for publications in general regardless of whether they are online or offline, or whether the publication is distributed as a single unit or not. In some cases, for example due to legislative reasons, the demands on digital publications may be more stringent than for generic web sites. The use cases below provide some examples for the publication-specific situations.

      <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>(On Accessibility) Asmait uses a dedicated braille e-reader capable of using standard OWP technologies, that can render any WCAG-compliant content.

        <li>(On Accessibility) Legal Publishing Ltd. publishes all the official texts, as issued by the government of its country. Per local legislation, the publication must be accessible, following <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>’s WCAG Level AA requirements, to serve as official references in courts.</li>

        <li>(On Privacy, Accessibility) EducationPublishing Ltd. publishes digital textbooks to cover BigUniversity’s curriculae. These (digital) educational publications also include access to interactive tests via specialized services on the web that regularly access the student’s progress. The privacy and the integrity of the student’s test data must be preserved (whether they are embedded in the publication or online). This, and the fact that digital textbooks must also abide to WCAG Level AA requirement in terms of accessibility, are such that EducationPublishing is liable in case they are not fulfilled.
        </li>

        <li>(On Privacy) Thomas has written a pamphlet advocating a government overthrow. The King has decreed that the author of the pamphlet shall be put to death and readers of the pamphlet shall be jailed. Thomas needs to distribute the pamphlet in ways that preserve his anonymity and allow the public to read without fear of the King's cyber-goons.
        </li>
        
        <li>(On Internationalization) PublicationInternational SA. publishes literary work all over the world and in many languages. In order to continue its business in Japan, it must be able to produce digital publications with right-to-left and vertical writing, and following the Japanese typesetting traditions, because that is the only way those publications are accepted by local customers.
        </li>

        <li>(On Device Independence) Vera has several devices she uses to read her books, depending on where she is. She uses her table with a larger screen when sitting in an armchair at home, her phone when commuting to her work by train, and her laptop when adding more complex annotations to the book. The book is authored in a way that, while maintaining the integrity of data like bookmarks and annotations, the book is automatically adapted to a different screen size, or to the fact that her phone does not have a keyboard.</li>

        <li>(On Security) BigAirline uses digital versions of the airline manuals. This means that the manuals are put “online” to keep them up-to-date, and the pilots have access to the latest version even when they are flying, i.e., they are off line. The way the manuals are authors and managed ensures that the integrity of the manuals and the relevant data is maintained at all times, to secure that the pilots operate based on correct information only.</li>

    <p>We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of which have survived with little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions, such as making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity. Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. The PWP offers this potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest, update, and describe digital publications. Long-term preservation of digital publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible, beyond the tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing platforms.
