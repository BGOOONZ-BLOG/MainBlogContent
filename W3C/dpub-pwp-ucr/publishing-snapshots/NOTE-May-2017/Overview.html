    <p>
      Publications, from corporate memos to newsletters to electronic books to scholarly journal articles, must be considered first-class content on the Web, equal to the more common forms of Web pages available today. This document describes the various use cases highlighting the problems users and publishers face when these publications are to be used in a digital, Web environment. The requirements that come from those use cases provide the basis for the technical considerations in a companion document, currently entitled ‚ÄúWeb Publications‚Äù&nbsp;[<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-pwp">pwp</a></cite>].

    </h2>

    <p>The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within domains and with explicit navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites. This model inherited very little from an existing, powerful and much older page-based media: books.</p>

    <p>Over centuries, ‚Äúbooks‚Äù have assumed many forms: journals, magazines, pamphlets of long-form articles and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics, notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different manifestations as ‚Äúpublications‚Äù: bound editions of meaningful media, made public.</p>

    <p>Another form of publication that also has a long history in both the printed as well as the digital world are documents. These are publications that are written and distributed in a more ad-hoc manner, such as legal briefs, corporate memos, and even the definitions of standards, such as this content currently being read.</p>

    <p>We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition of portable, bounded publications with the pervasive accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New models of economic sustainability, innovative experiences of knowledge, and invigorated socio-cultural engagement depend on this.</p>

    <p>It is the task of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> to explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing these two great models of publishing together. This document explores requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios. Requirements for publications on the Web are explored first, without referring to any packaging aspect that would correspond to current practices like EPUB. This is followed by requirements of those packaging aspects, as a structure on top of a purely Web-based distribution. The complete list of requirements is also collected in a separate table in

        <p class="req-set" id="r_owp"><a href="#r_owp">Req.&nbsp;1</a>: Web Publications should be able to make use of all features offered by the OWP.</p>

        <p>There is a remarkable development of tools and frameworks built on top of OWP that make it possible to develop powerful interactive layers on top of OWP. These include, for example, data visualization systems (e.g., d3, built on top of SVG), possibilities to access external services like Wolfram Alpha, or tools to create and store (possibly as part of the publication) annotations. These tools have been traditionally developed around browsers, and provide possibilities that publications should also benefit from. That requires that <a data-lt="Web Publication" href="#dfn-web-publication" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">Web Publications</a> become first class citizens on the Web platform.</p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
          <li>A large, multidisciplinary, Web-based journal relies on traditional Web technologies like HTML and CSS for its content. The journal, responding to the evolving expectations of its audience, is increasingly using additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, and very large images; the trend is to consider these as integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a result needs access to the latest visualization and other data management tools that the OWP-based tools can offer.
          </li>

          <li>Educational publications are increasingly making use of OWP features. They include interactive exams (possibly linked to online evaluation facilities), visualization of data or of algorithms, built-in interpreters for various languages (e.g., for courses on programming); in many respects, the borderline between these publications and Web applications is becoming fuzzy.
          </li>

          <li id="in_house_doc">BigBoxCo, a large technology company with extensive ‚Äúin-house‚Äù documentation to support the technical and/or user documentation for their various products and administrative processes, develops all this material in digital-only formats. The quantity of documentation makes it impractical to produce these documents in print. Instead, the company publishes them on the company intranet, and/or provides them to their employees and contractors via specialized mobile applications. These documents, as a type of publication, require accessibility, portability of annotations, and the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

        <p class="req-set" id="r_horizdep"><a href="#r_horizdep">Req.&nbsp;2</a>: A Web Publication should conform to the requirements of all horizontal dependencies.</p>

        <p>Web content has to be consumed under different circumstances: it must be available to the largest possible audience in a secure manner, providing the necessary protection of the reader‚Äôs privacy. Publication content must be able to answer to a number of principles like accessibility, internationalization, device independence, security, and privacy. (These are usually referred to, in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> context, as ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Accessibility:</dt>
          <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access the content of a publication. They should be able to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the content, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.</dd>

          <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
          <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language, writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left, horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>

          <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
          <dd>The content in a publication should be usable on a large number of devices with very different device characteristics: different screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying level of processing power, etc. These different affordances should be automatic with no, or very little, user intervention.</dd>

          <dt>Security:</dt>
          <dd>Publications should be presented by a User Agent using a security model that is at least (if not more) secure than the standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/runtime/">Web security model</a>. Doing this will prevent publications that contain malicious attacks, data theft, and other security incidents from impacting users by jeopardizing the integrity of the underlying data or machine operations.</dd>

          <dt>Privacy:</dt>
          <dd>The content in a publication should maintain and support user privacy, in spite of the fact that the evolution of online technologies has increased the possibility for the collection and processing of personal, and possibly sensitive, data. However, since a publication may use <a href="#pwp-owp">any part of the OWP</a>, it may choose to use functionality such as the ability to track a user's activity within the publication.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible extension to Web Publications) insofar as the technologies must empower the authors (writers, editors, publishers, etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether authors use the possibilities of these technologies or not is not addressed in this document.</p>

        <p>All these constraints are formalized in the context of the usage on the Web and by extension Web Publications. This means that they are valid for publications in general. In some cases, for example due to legislative reasons, the demands on publications may be more stringent than for generic Web sites. The use cases below provide some examples for the publication-specific situations. Note also that some aspect of horizontal dependencies (e.g., accessibility or security), are also the subject of further use cases and requirements elsewhere in this document.

      <p>We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of which have survived with little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions, such as making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity. Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. Packaged Web Publications offer this potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest, update, and describe digital publications. Long-term preservation of digital publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible, beyond the tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing platforms.
      </p>

      <p>Fundamental use cases and requirements already help aid our archiving requirements. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a class="req-ref-full" href="#r_con-res">Req.&nbsp;14: The information regarding the
