The [Digital Publishing Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG), that managed this repository, ***is now closed***, and so is this repository. Activities in the group has been taken up by:

* The [Publishing Business Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-bg)
* The [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-bg)
* The [EPUB 3 Community Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub3-cg)

All these groups are part of the [Publishing@W3C](https://www.w3.org/publishing), born out of the merger of IDPF and W3C.
