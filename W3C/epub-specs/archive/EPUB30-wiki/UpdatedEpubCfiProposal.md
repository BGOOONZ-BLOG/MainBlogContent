# EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifiers #

The Web has proven that the concept of hyperlinking is tremendously powerful. Until now, EPUBs have been denied much of this benefit because there has been no standardized method of referencing content within an EPUB document. This specification seeks to remedy that situation.

## Details ##

The updated EPUB CFI proposal, representing substantive additional work and response to comments, done by Adobe, Apple, and Google, can be found at:

## Going Forward ##

EPUB Working Group vetting is desired; please comment on this page.  It is anticipated that EPUB CFI will be the first linking scheme included in the "registry" as proposed by Markus.

## Update ##

Below please find the link to the updated version of the EPUB CFI document.  Many review comments have been addressed, and it is now much more like a "spec," suitable for Matt't round of editing.
