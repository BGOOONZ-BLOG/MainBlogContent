<p>The <strong><code>HTMLMediaElement.seekToNextFrame()</code></strong> method asynchronously advances the current play position to the next frame in the media.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This non-standard method is part of an experimentation process around support for non-real-time access to media for tasks including filtering, editing, and so forth. You should <em>not</em> use this method in production code, because its implementation may change—or be removed outright—without notice. You are, however, invited to experiment with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This method lets you access frames of video media without the media being performed in real time. This also lets you access media using frames as a seek unit rather than timecodes (albeit only by seeking one frame at a time until you get to the frame you want). Possible uses for this method include filtering and editing of video content.</p>
<p>This method returns immediately, returning a {{jsxref(“Promise”)}}, whose fulfillment handler is called when the seek operation is complete. In addition, a {{event(“seeked”)}} event is sent to let interested parties know that a seek has taken place. If the seek fails because the media is already at the last frame, a {{event(“seeked”)}} event occurs, followed immediately by an {{event(“ended”)}} event.</p>
<p>If there is no video on the media element, or the media isn’t seekable, nothing happens.</p>
