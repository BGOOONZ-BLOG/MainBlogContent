    This specification defines the 5th major version, first minor revision of the core language of
    the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, new features continue
    to be introduced to help Web application authors, new elements continue to be introduced based
    on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention continues to be given to
    defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability.
