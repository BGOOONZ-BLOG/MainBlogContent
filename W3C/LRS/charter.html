      <h1 id="title">License &amp; Rights Statements Working Group Charter (Draft)</h1>
      <p>The ease of access to online content, whether it's text, video or data, often leaves the question of rights and licenses unanswered. In many cases this is unimportant: a reader does not need to know and will rarely care what license terms are associated with an online article. However, if content is to be re-used in some way – perhaps an image is being re-used in another article, a presentation is embedded in a Web page, or a dataset is being used in a novel application - then the terms and conditions of use are important. If the re-user is a commercial operation then the terms are critical. The situation becomes more complex if multiple resources are used in a single publication or application, each with its own license terms. Can they be used together? If so, what are the license terms of the new work?</p>

      <p>Several attempts have been made to solve this problem, not least Creative Commons which, since 2001, has worked to 'keep the internet creative, free and open' by offering a set of widely understood licenses. Other well known licenses include GPL, MIT, Apache, the UK Open Government Licence  and more. In May 2013, the Open Data Institute developed its vocabulary for Open Data Rights Statements. In each case, the aim is to offer clear information on what can and can't be done with the relevant resource.</p>

<p>The Open Digital Rights Language, ODRL, addresses a large number of use cases. Driven largely by the publishing industry, it offers “&hellip;a flexible and interoperable information model to support transparent and innovative use of digital assets in the publishing, distribution and consumption of content, applications, and services across all sectors and communities.”</p>
      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the  License &amp; Rights Statements Working Group, part of the <a href="/2013/data/">Data Activity</a>, is to develop standards to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>allow <strong>automated or semi-automated processing of license information/rights statements</strong> to determine what permissions and obligations are associated with a given resource;</li>
        <li>automatically, or semi-automatically, <strong>generate license/rights statements</strong> for new work derived from resources that are themselves covered by such restrictions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Without wishing to limit its ability to fulfill these goals as it sees fit, the <abbr title="License &amp; Rights Statements">LRS</abbr> WG is explicitly asked to re-use and build upon existing work as much as possible, noting that implementation and investment in Creative Commons and ODRL in particular are significant.</p>

        <p>The License &amp; Rights Statements WG will take into account the needs of as wide a community as possible including commercial and non-commercial publishers, consumers and re-users of human readable content and machine readable data. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="noscope">Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>Access control mechanisms, digital rights management. Legal information is clearly in scope, however, it is not the task of the Working Group to try and encode laws directly, nor to define a system designed to be legally rigorous. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
        <p>The titles of the deliverables are not final; the Working Group will
          have to decide on the final titles as well as the structures of the
          documents. The Working Group may also decide to merge some
          deliverables into one document or produce several documents that
          together constitute one of the deliverables.</p>

        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>To advance the encoding specifications to Proposed Recommendation, evidence will be gathered of independent deployments of license/rights data (at least two per encoding).</p>
<p>For the processing model, evidence will be gathered of independent implementations where license/rights statement data has been gathered and used in a relevant application, such as a publishing tool chain, data portal etc.</p>

      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
      <p>To be successful, the License &amp; Rights Statements Working Group is
        expected to have 20 or more active participants for its duration. To get
        the most out of this work, participants should expect to devote several
        hours a week; for budgeting purposes, we recommend at least half a day a
        week. For chairs and document editors the commitment will be higher,
        say, 1-2 days a week. Participants who follow the work less closely
        should be aware that if they miss decisions through inattention further
        discussion of those issues may be ruled out of order. However, most
        participants follow some areas of discussion more closely than others,
        and the time needed to stay in good standing therefore varies from week
        to week. The Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources
        for building Test Suites for each specification.</p>

      <p>This group primarily conducts its work on the

        Comments on the group's work will be welcome via the

      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
      <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
          3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
        consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after
        due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a
        decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.
        <br />
        <br />
        A formal vote should allow for remote asynchronous participation—using,
        for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques. Any resolution
        taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is to be considered
        provisional until 5 working days after the publication of the resolution
        in draft minutes sent to the group's mailing list. </p>
      <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section
          3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting
        procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>
