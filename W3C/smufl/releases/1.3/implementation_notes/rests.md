Scoring applications should draw multiple measure rests using primitives
to provide variable width and line thickness rather than using **restHBar**.

“Old style” multiple measure rests can be created by laying out
**restLonga** (four bars), **restDoubleWhole** (two bars) and **restWhole** (one
bar) next to each other.

For dotted rests, the augmentation dot glyph **augmentationDot** should be
used.
