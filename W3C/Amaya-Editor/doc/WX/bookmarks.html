<h1><a name="What">Bookmark support in Amaya</a></h1>

<p><strong>NOTE: This is a beta version of the Annotea bookmarks
implementation in Amaya. The User Interface needs more work and it only works
for the moment on Linux.</strong></p>

<p>Beginning from Version 8.1, Amaya supports the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2003/07/Annotea/BookmarkSchema-20030707.html">Annotea
Bookmark schema</a>. Follow the link for a better description of this RDF
schema. This document describes the user interface and known bugs of its
implementation inside Amaya.</p>

<p>The user interface is very similar to that found in other browsers and it
allows you to do most of the same operations. One notable difference is that
the Annotea Bookmarks schema uses the term <em>Topic</em> rather than
<em>Folder</em>. The reason for this choice is that the organization of this
kind of bookmarks os not limited to strict hierarchies, but can be extended
to full graphs.</p>

<h2>Bookmark Menu</h2>

<p>The user can access the bookmarks functionality by means of the
<em>Bookmarks</em> menu in the menu bar:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/bmmenu.png"
alt="Bookmark menu in the menu bar" border="1" /></p>

<p>The operations that this menu proposes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>New Bookmark</em>: opens a widget for adding the current document
    to the bookmarks file.</li>
  <li><em>New Topic</em>: opens a widget for adding a new topic to the
    bookmarks file.</li>
  <li><em>View bookmarks</em>: displays the bookmarks file.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will examine each of these operations in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Creating a new bookmark</h2>

<p>When you want to bookmark a given document that you're browsing, invoke
the <em>New Bookmark</em> function from the menu bar. This will open the
<em>Bookmark Properties</em> widget:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/bmbprop.png"
alt="Bookmark Properties Widget" border="1" /></p>
</div>

<p>A bookmark can belong to one or more topics. The <strong>Topic
Hierarchy</strong> field displays the current topics that you have and lets
you select the topics where you want to classify your bookmark. For example,
the above figure shows a bookmark tha tbelongs to the INRIA and W3C Topics.
Note that a bookmark must always belong to a topic. Amaya will refuse to
create the bookmark if this is not the case. You can create a new topic from
this widget by using the <strong>New Topic</strong> button, at the bottom of
the widget.</p>

<p>The <strong>Title</strong> field gives the title of the bookmark. If the
document you're bookmarking is written in a markup language that Amaya
understand (e.g., XHTML, HTML, ...) and if this document has recognizable
title element, the value of this element will be used for this field.
Otherwise, the URL of the document will be shown.</p>

<p>The <strong>Recalls</strong> field gives the URL of the document that this
bookmark points to.</p>

<p>The <strong>Created</strong> and <strong>Last Modified</strong> fields
give the time of creation and of last modification of the bookmark,
respectively.</p>

<p>The <strong>Description</strong> field allows you to give an optional text
describing the bookmark.</p>

<p>The <strong>Apply</strong> button allows you to add the bookmark to the
bookmark file or, if you're modifying it, to update it.</p>

<p>The <strong>New Topic</strong> button opens the <em>Topics Properties</em>
widget to let you create a new topic.</p>

<p>The <strong>Done</strong> button closes the widget and discards any
changes that were not saved.</p>

<div id="page_body1">
<h2>Creating a new topic</h2>

<p>When you want to create a new topic, invoke the <em>New Topic</em>
function from the menu bar. This will open the Topic<em>Properties</em>
widget:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/bmtprop.png"
alt="Topic Properties Widget" border="1" /></p>
</div>

<p>In this implementqtion, topics have to have a hierarichal organization.
That is, each topic has a parent topic and can have sub topics stored under
it. By default, there is a root topic, called <em>Home Topic</em>, that is
automatically generated. All new topics that you will be created will be
stored under it.</p>

<p>The <strong>Topic Hierarchy</strong> field displays the current topics
that you have and lets you choose the topic under which you want to store the
new topic. For example, the figure shows the <em>W3C</em> topic that is
stored under the <em>Home Topic</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>All the other fields in this widget have the same meaning as those
described in the Bookmark Widget, in the precedent setion.</p>

<p>The <strong>Apply</strong> button allows you to add the topic to the
bookmark file or, if you're modifying it, to update it.</p>

<p>The <strong>Done</strong> button closes the widget and discards any
changes that were not saved.</p>

<div id="page_body11">
<h2>Viewing your bookmarks file</h2>

<p>When you want to view and use your bookmark file, invoke the <em>View
Bookmarks</em> function from the menu bar. This will open a new window
displaying your bookmarks and topics:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/bmview1.png"
alt="Topic Properties Widget" border="2" /></p>
</div>

<p></p>

<p>In the bookmark view, topics entries are prefixed with either a <img
alt="collapsed topic" src="../images/closed.png" /> or a <img
alt="expanded topic" src="../images/open.png" /> icon. The other entries are
bookmarks. You can either activate entries by clicking on the left mouse
button or view the properties of an entry by using the right mouse button. If
you're viewing the properties of an entry, you can also edit them and save
the modifications.</p>

<p>For a bookmark entry, the left mouse button will open a new window
displaying the document that the bookmark recalls. For a topic entry, the
left mouse button will either collapse or expand its contents. The <img
alt="collapsed topic" src="../images/closed.png" /> icon represents a
collapsed topic entry and the <img alt="expanded topic"
src="../images/open.png" /> icon an expand topic entry.</p>

<p>In order to delete an entry, you have to put the cursor in the entry and
select it by pressing the <code>F2</code> key:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../images/bmview2.png"
alt="Selecting a topic and its entries" border="2" /></p>

<p>Once the entry is selected, you just need to press the <em>Delete</em> key
to erase it. If you select a topic entry, all of its children will be also
selected and deleted with this operation. Note that for bookmarks that belong
to multiple topics, deleting its entry from a topic, only destroys one RDF
property that says that this bookmark belongs to that topic. In order to
completely delete a bookmark that belongs to multiple topics, you will need
to delete its entry in all those topics. Alternatively, you can first edit
its properties and make it belong to only one topic, then delete it.</p>

<h2>For hackers</h2>

<p>The bookmarks are stored in the Amaya preferences directory under the name
<em>bookmarks.rdf</em>. If you edit this file and add additional properties,
they will be preserved. This is due to our using Redland for parsing and
querying the RDF model. For more information, see the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/">Annotea</a> project home page.</p>
