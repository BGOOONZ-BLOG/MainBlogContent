**Overview**

This document aims to standardize the Web of Things by defining a set of specific implementation and resource design guidelines to be followed by anyone wanting to create a product, device, service, or application for the Web of Things.

The following guidelines and recommendations will ensure interoperability across all entities on the Web of Things. Unlike other custom (non-Web) protocols used for M2M that cause a “parallel universe” to the existing Web; the Web of Things is designed to be seamlessly integrated to the existing Web so it can fully leverage its infrastructure and standards to minimize integrations across applications and systems.

## Proposal Sturcture

The proposal is composed of three sub-parts:

* **Integration Patterns**. This section discusses the way Things are integrated to the Web. It proposes 3 different patterns, Direct Connectivity, Gateway Based Connectivity, Cloud Based Connectivity.

* **Web Things (WT) Requirements**. This part doesn’t introduce any specific data naming conventions of domain-specific models. It is solely composed of multiple constraints and recommendations on how the protocol should be implemented so that any entity on the Web of Things can easily interact with each other. All WTs MUST implement all the MUST constraints of these requirements and if technically possible the SHOULD constraints as well. Respecting these requirements turns an HTTP server into a Web Thing.

* **Web Things Model**. Once a WT follows the conventions defined above, it is then capable to read and exchange data with any other entities of the Web of Things. However, it doesn’t mean it can “understand” what the object is, what data or services it offers, etc. Therefore, the second component of this specification proposes an HTTP and WebSockets based protocol with a set of resources, data models, payload syntax and semantic extensions that WT and applications should follow. Respecting these requirements turns an Web Thing into an Interoperable Web Thing. Implementing semantic extensions (e.g., via JSON-LD) turns the Interoperable Web Thing into a Semantic Web Thing.

## Entities

The following entities are considered in this proposal:

* **Web Things (WT)**. A Web Thing is virtual representation of a physical object (a Thing) accessible on the Web. Examples of Web Things are: an Arduino board, a garage door, a bottle of soda, a building, a TV, etc. It could also be an intermediate in the network such as a Gateway or a Cloud service.

* **Actions** are requests that an external entity can send to a WT, which may or may not change the internal state of the WT. This is used mainly to send commands or notifications to a physical object. Examples of Actions are “open” or “close” for a garage door, “enable” or “disable” for a smoke alarm. “Checkin” or “Scan” for a bottle of soda. The direction of an Action is Client -> Web Thing 

* **Events** are notifications generated by Web Things. The direction of an Event is Web Thing -> Clients

* **Properties** are values reflecting the current (and possibly historical) internal state of a Web Thing.

Additionally, a **Client** refers to any physical or digital entity that can interact with a Web Thing. This can be a mobile application, a Web browser, a proxy, a desktop application but also another Web Things (e.g., in the case of Machine to Machine communication).
