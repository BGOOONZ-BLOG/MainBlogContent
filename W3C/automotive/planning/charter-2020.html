	<p>This group will develop information service specifications for exposing
	vehicle telematics data, other data following similar
	taxonomies as well as exposing vehicle centric functions.</p>

<p>Services may include but are not limited to</p><ul>
				<li>Vehicle Telematics Data
				<ul><li>vehicle brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, steering wheel position, tire pressure, oil level, wiper position, lights, doors, windows and seat settings as well as navigation, trip computer data, climate control data, speed, RPMs, acceleration, gears, &#8230;</li></ul></li>
				<li>A named remote procedure API with
				accompanying functions to be
				defined collaboratively in GENIVI's <a href="https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_service_catalog">Vehicle Service Catalog</a>
				(digital key, remote delivery,
				electric vehicle charging, geofencing)

	  <p> This Working Group will not define or mandate implementation details including vehicle, network or sensor protocols for sharing data between the vehicle data network and sensors. The vehicle data bus network and protocols are OEM specific and vary from vehicle to vehicle.</p>

<p>However, to facilitate interoperability among vehicle OEMs and encourage adoption of the specifications, the group may informatively reference existing suites of protocols, either directly in the deliverable(s) or in a non-normative companion Note.</p>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>

<p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
	  <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to
	  specifications should have <a
	  href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>
	  and working prototype code examples.</p>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal
        review</a> for accessibility, internationalization,
        performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working
        and Interest Groups, and with the <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical
        Architecture Group">TAG</a>.  Invitation for review must be
        issued during each major standards-track document transition,
        including <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD"
        title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The Working
        Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the
        horizontal review groups throughout development of each
        specification.  The Working
        Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before
        first entering <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR"
        title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to
        proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major
        changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/auto/wg">Automotive Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Automotive Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-auto" href="mailto:public-automotive@w3.org">public-automotive@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-automotive/">archive</a>)
          and on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/automotive/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period of <span id='cfc'>one week</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
