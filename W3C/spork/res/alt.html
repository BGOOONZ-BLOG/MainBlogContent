  <h5 id="alt">Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images</h5>

  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#text-altdef">Text alternatives</a>, <a href="#refsWCAG">[WCAG]</a>
  are a primary way of making visual information accessible, because they can be rendered through any
  sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows
  the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture
  can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code>alt</code> attribute on images is a very important accessibility attribute.
  Authoring useful <code>alt</code> attribute content requires the author to carefully consider the context in
  which the image appears and the function that image may have in that context. The guidance included
  here addresses the most common ways authors use images. Additional guidance and techniques are available in <a href="http://w3.org/WAI/alt/">Resources on Alternative Text for Images</a>.</p>

  <ul>
      <li>They have a very slow connection and are browsing with images disabled.</li>
      <li>They have a vision impairment and use text to speech software.</li>
      <li>They have a cognitive impairment and use text to speech software.</li>
      <li>They are using a text-only browser.</li>
      <li>They are listening to the page being read out by a voice Web browser.</li>
      <li>They have images disabled to save on download costs.</li>
      <li>They have problems loading images or the source of an image is wrong.</li>

  <h6 id="general-guidelines">General guidelines</h6>

  <p>Except where otherwise specified, the <code>alt</code> attribute must be specified and its value must not be empty;
  the value must be an appropriate functional replacement for the image. The specific requirements for the <code>alt</code> attribute content
  depend on the image's function in the page, as described in the following sections.</p>

  <p>To determine an appropriate text alternative it is important to think about why an image is being included in a page.
  What is its purpose? Thinking like this will help you to understand what is important about the image for the
  intended audience. Every image has a reason for being on a page, because it provides useful information, performs a
  function, labels an interactive element, enhances aesthetics or is purely decorative. Therefore, knowing what the image
  is for, makes writing an appropriate text alternative easier.</p>

  <h6 id="a-link-or-button-containing-nothing-but-an-image">A link or button containing nothing but an image</h6>

  <p>When an <code><a href="#the-a-element">a</a></code> element that is a <a href="#hyperlink">hyperlink</a>, or a <code><a href="#the-button-element">button</a></code> element, has no text content
 but contains one or more images, include text in the <code>alt</code> attribute(s) that together convey the purpose of the link or button.</p>

	<div class="example">

  <p>In this example, a portion of an editor interface is displayed. Each button has an icon representing an action a user can take on content they are editing. For users who cannot view the images, the action names are included within the <code>alt</code> attributes of the images:</p>
  <p><img alt="5 buttons: bold, italic, strike through, bulleted list and numbered list." src="images/buttons1.png"></p>

  <pre>  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;button&gt;&lt;img src="b.png" <strong>alt="Bold"</strong>&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;button&gt;&lt;img src="i.png" <strong>alt="Italics"</strong>&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  <div class="example">

  <p>In this example, a link contains a logo. The link points to the W3C web site <strong>from an external site</strong>. The text alternative is
  a brief description of the link target.</p>
  <p><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium"><img alt="W3C logo used as link content." height="48" src="images/w3c_home.png" width="72"></abbr></p>

	<div class="example">
  <p>This example is the same as the previous example, except that the <strong>link is on the W3C web site</strong>. The text alternative is

  </pre>
  <p class="note">Depending on the context in which an image of a logo is used it could be appropriate to provide an indication, as part of the text alternative, that the image is a <em>logo</em>. Refer to section <a href="#logos,-insignia,-flags,-or-emblems">4.7.1.1.19 Logos, insignia, flags, or emblems</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In this example, a link contains a print preview icon. The link points to a version of the page with a
  print stylesheet applied. The text alternative is a brief description of the link target.</p>
  <p><img alt="Print preview icon used as link content." height="30" src="images/preview.png" width="32"></p>

  <h6 id="graphical-representations:-charts,-diagrams,-graphs,-maps,-illustrations">Graphical Representations: Charts, diagrams, graphs, maps, illustrations</h6>

  <p>Users can benefit when content is presented in graphical form, for example as a
  flowchart, a diagram, a graph, or a map showing directions. Users also benefit when
  content presented in a graphical form is also provided in a textual format, these users include
  those who are unable to view the image (e.g. because they have a very slow connection,
  or because they are using a text-only browser, or because they are listening to the page
  being read out by a hands-free automobile voice Web browser, or because they have a
  visual impairment and use an assistive technology to render the text to speech).</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In the following example we have an image of a pie chart, with text in the <code>alt</code> attribute
  representing the data shown in the pie chart:</p>
  <p><img alt="Browser Share: Internet Explorer 25%, Firefox 40%, Chrome 25%, Safari 6% and Opera 4%." height="299" src="images/browserShare.png" width="380"></p>

  <pre>  &lt;img src="piechart.gif" <strong>alt="Pie chart: Browser Share - Internet Explorer 25%, Firefox 40%, Chrome 25%, Safari 6% and Opera 4%."</strong>&gt;
  </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In the case where an image repeats the previous paragraph in graphical form. The <code>alt</code> attribute content labels the image.</p>

  <pre> &lt;p&gt;According to a recent study Firefox has a 40% browser share, Internet Explorer has 25%, Chrome has 25%, Safari has 6% and Opera has 4%.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="piechart.gif" <strong>alt="Pie chart representing the data in the previous paragraph."</strong>&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
  <p>It can be seen that when the image is not available, for example because the <code>src</code> attribute value is incorrect, the text alternative provides the user with a brief description of the image content:</p>
  <p><img alt="Representation of the code snippet above." src="images/brokenimg.png"></p>
  </div>

  <p class="note">In cases where the text alternative is lengthy, more than a sentence or two, or would benefit from
 the use of structured markup, provide a brief description or label using the <code>alt</code>
 attribute, and an associated text alternative.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>Here's an example of a flowchart image, with a short text alternative
  included in the <code>alt</code> attribute, in this case the text alternative is a description of the link target
  as the image is the sole content of a link. The link points to a description, within the same document, of the
  process represented in the flowchart.</p>

  <p><img alt="Flowchart: Dealing with a broken lamp." height="320" src="images/flowchart.png" width="221"></p>

  <pre>  <strong>
  &lt;a href="#desc"&gt;</strong>&lt;img src="flowchart.gif" <strong>alt="Flowchart: Dealing with a broken lamp."</strong>&gt;<strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong>

  ...

  ...

  &lt;div <strong>id="desc"</strong>&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Dealing with a broken lamp&lt;/h2&gt;
  <strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong>
  <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>Check if it's plugged in, if not, plug it in.<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
  <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>If it still doesn't work; check if the bulb is burned out. If it is, replace the bulb.<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
  <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>If it still doesn't work; buy a new lamp.<strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong>
  <strong>&lt;/ol&gt;</strong>
  &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In this example, there is an image of a chart. It would be inappropriate to provide the information depicted in
  the chart as a plain text alternative in an <code>alt</code> attribute as the information is a data set. Instead a
  structured text alternative is provided below the image in the form of a data table using the data that is represented
  in the chart image.</p>

  <p><img alt="Bar Chart showing average rainfall in millimetres by Country and Season." height="341" src="images/table.gif" width="407"></p>
  <p class="note">Indications of the highest and lowest rainfall for each season have been included in the
  table, so trends easily identified in the chart are also available in the data table.</p>

  <table style="border: 1px solid gray; width: 28em">

  <p class="note">The <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code> element is used to group the Bar Chart image and data table.
  The <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> element provides a caption for the grouped content.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="note">For any of the examples in this section the <code><a href="#the-details-element">details</a></code> and <code><a href="#the-summary-element">summary</a></code>
  elements could be used so that the text descriptions for the images are only displayed on demand:</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p><img alt="Details element in the closed state." src="images/altdetails-collapsed.png"></p>
  <p><img alt="Details element in the open state with list content displayed." src="images/altdetails-expanded.png"></p>
  <pre>  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="flowchart.gif" alt="Flowchart: Dealing with a broken lamp."&gt;
  <strong title="">&lt;details&gt;</strong>
  <strong>&lt;summary&gt;Dealing with a broken lamp&lt;/summary&gt;</strong>
  &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check if it's plugged in, if not, plug it in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it still doesn't work; check if the bulb is burned out. If it is, replace the bulb.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it still doesn't work; buy a new lamp.&lt;/li&gt;

  <p class="note">The <code><a href="#the-details-element">details</a></code> and <code><a href="#the-summary-element">summary</a></code> elements are not currently well supported by browsers, until such times they are supported, if used, you will need to use scripting to provide the functionality. There are a number of scripted Polyfills and scripted custom controls available, in popular JavaScript UI widget libraries, which provide similar functionality.</p>

  <h6 id="images-of-text">Images of text</h6>

  <p>Sometimes, an image only contains  text, and the purpose of the image
  is to display text  using visual effects and /or fonts.  It is <em>strongly</em>
  recommended that text styled using CSS be used, but if this is not possible, provide
  the same text in the <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute as is in the image.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>This example shows an image of the text "Get Happy!" written in a fancy multi colored freehand style.
   The image makes up the content of a heading. In this case the text alternative for the image is "Get Happy!".</p>

   <p><img alt="Get Happy!" height="77" src="images/text.png" width="275"></p>

  <pre>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img src="gethappy.gif" <strong>alt="Get Happy!"</strong>&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In this example we have an advertising image consisting of text, the phrase "The BIG sale" is
   repeated 3 times, each time the text gets smaller and fainter, the last line reads "...ends Friday"
   In the context of use, as an advertisement, it is recommended that the image's text alternative only include the text "The BIG sale"
   once as the repetition is for visual effect and the repetition of the text for users who cannot view
   the image is unnecessary and could be confusing.</p>

  <p><img alt="The big sale ...ends Friday." height="190" src="images/sale.png" width="400"></p>
  <pre>  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="sale.gif" <strong>alt="The BIG sale ...ends Friday."</strong>&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
  <p class="note">In situations where there is also a photo or other graphic along with the image of text,
    ensure that the words in the image text are included in the text alternative, along with any other description
    of the image that conveys meaning to users who can view the image, so the information is also
    available to users who cannot view the image.</p>
  </div>
 <p>When an image is used to represent a character that cannot otherwise be represented in Unicode,
  for example gaiji, itaiji, or new characters such as novel currency symbols, the text alternative
  should be a more conventional way of writing the same thing, e.g. using the phonetic hiragana or
  katakana to give the character's pronunciation.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example from 1997, a new-fangled currency symbol that looks like a curly E with two
   bars in the middle instead of one is represented using an image. The alternative text gives the
   character's pronunication.</p>

<p>Only <img alt="euro " height="18" src="images/euro.png" width="21">5.99!</p>

   <pre>&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;img src="euro.png" alt="euro "&gt;5.99!</pre>

  </div>

  <p>An image should not be used if Unicode characters would serve an identical purpose. Only when
  the text cannot be directly represented using Unicode, e.g. because of decorations or because the
  character is not in the Unicode character set (as in the case of gaiji), would an image be
  appropriate.</p>

  <p class="note">If an author is tempted to use an image because their default system font does not
  support a given character, then Web Fonts are a better solution than images.</p>
  <!-- Fork - move example to correct section and add image example SF-->
  <div class="example">

   <p>An illuminated manuscript might use graphics for some of its letters. The text alternative in
   such a situation is just the character that the image represents.</p>
   <p><img alt="O" height="32" src="images/fancyO.png" width="24">nce upon a time and a long long time ago...</p>
   <pre>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="initials/fancyO.png" <mark>alt="O"</mark>&gt;nce upon a time and a long long time ago...</pre>

  <h6 id="images-that-include-text">Images that include text</h6>

  <p>Sometimes, an image consists of a graphics such as a chart and associated text.
  In this case it is recommended that the text in the image is included in the text alternative.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>Consider an image containing  a pie chart and associated text. It is recommended wherever
  possible to provide any associated text as text, not an image of text.
  If this is not possible include the text in the text alternative along with the pertinent information
  conveyed in the image.</p>

  <p><img alt="Figure 1. Distribution of Articles by Journal
  Category. Pie chart: Language=68%, Education=14% and Science=18%." height="279" id="piechart" src="images/figure1.png" width="351"></p>
  <pre>  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="figure1.gif" <strong>alt="Figure 1. Distribution of Articles by Journal Category.
  Pie chart: Language=68%, Education=14% and Science=18%."</strong>&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>Here's another example of the same <a href="#piechart">pie chart</a> image,
  showing a short text alternative included in the <code>alt</code> attribute
  and a longer text alternative in text. The <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code> and <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code>
  elements are used to associate the longer text alternative with the image. The <code>alt</code> attribute is used
  to label the image.</p>

  <pre>  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="figure1.gif" <strong>alt="Figure 1"</strong>&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Distribution of Articles by Journal Category.
  Pie chart: Language=68%, Education=14% and Science=18%.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  </pre>
  <p class="note">The advantage of this method over the previous example is that the text alternative
  is available to all users at all times. It also allows structured mark up to be used in the text
  alternative, where as a text alternative provided using the <code>alt</code> attribute does not.</p>

  <h6 id="images-that-enhance-the-themes-or-subject-matter-of-the-page-content">Images that enhance the themes or subject matter of the page content</h6>

  <p>An image that isn't discussed directly by the surrounding text but still has
  some relevance can be included in a page using the <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element. Such images
  are more than mere decoration, they may augment the themes or subject matter of the page
  content and so still form part of the content. In these cases, it is recommeneded that a
  text alternative be provided. </p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>Here is an example of an image closely related to the subject matter of the page content
  but not directly discussed. An image of a painting inspired by a poem, on a page reciting that poem.
  The following snippet shows an example. The image is a painting titled the "Lady of Shallot", it is
  inspired by the poem and its subject matter is derived from the poem. Therefore it is strongly
  recommended that a text alternative is provided. There is a short description of the content of
  the image in the <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute and
  a link below the image to a longer description located at the bottom of the document. At the end
  of the longer description there is also a link to further information about the painting.</p>
  <p><img alt="A painting inspired by Alfred Tennyson's poem The Lady of Shalott" height="234" src="images/shalott.jpg" width="338"></p>

  <p>In many cases, the image is actually just supplementary, and its presence merely reinforces the
  surrounding text. In these cases, the <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute must be
  present but its value must be the empty string.</p>

  <p>In general, an image falls into this category if removing the image doesn't make the page any
  less useful, but including the image makes it a lot easier for users of visual browsers to
  understand the concept.</p>


  <div class="example">
  <p>It is not always easy to write a useful text alternative for an image, another option is to provide a link to a
  description or further information about the image when one is available. </p>
  <p>In this example of  the same image, there is a short text alternative included in the <code>alt</code> attribute, and
  there is a link after the image. The link points to a page containing <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&amp;workid=15984">information about the painting</a>. </p>

  <p>Purely decorative images are visual enhancements, decorations or embellishments that provide no
  function or information beyond aesthetics to users who can view the images.</p>

  <p>Mark up purely decorative images so they can be ignored by assistive technology by using an empty <code>alt</code>
  attribute (<code>alt=""</code>). While it is not unacceptable to include decorative images inline,
  it is recommended if they are purely decorative to include the image using CSS.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>Here's an example of an image being used as a decorative banner for a person's blog, the image offers no information
  and so an empty <code>alt</code> attribute is used.</p>

  <div>
  <p><img alt="" height="30" src="images/border.png" width="400"></p>
  <p><strong>Clara's Blog</strong></p>
  <p>Welcome to my blog...</p>

  <h6 id="inline">Inline images</h6>

  <p>When images are used inline as part of the flow of text in a sentence, provide a word or phrase as a text
  alternative which makes sense in the context of the sentence it is apart of.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>I <img alt="love" height="24" src="images/heart.png" width="27"> you.</p>

  <pre>I &lt;img src="heart.png" <strong>alt="love"</strong>&gt; you.</pre>

  <p>My <img alt="heart" height="24" src="images/heart.png" width="27"> breaks.</p>

  <p>When a picture has been sliced into smaller image files that are then displayed
  together to form the complete picture again, include a text alternative for one
  of the images using the <code>alt</code> attribute as per the relevant relevant
  guidance for the picture as a whole, and then include an empty <code>alt</code>
  attribute on the other images.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In this example, a picture representing a company logo for the <i>PIP Corporation</i>
  has been split into two pieces, the first containing the letters "PIP" and the second with the word "CO".
  The text alternatve <i>PIP CO</i> is in the <code>alt</code> attribute of the first image.</p>

  <p><img alt="Image containing the text 'PIP'." height="64" src="images/pip.gif" width="99"><img alt="Image containing the text 'CO'." height="64" src="images/co.gif" width="103"></p>

  <pre>  &lt;img src="pip.gif" <strong>alt="PIP CO"</strong>&gt;&lt;img src="co.gif" <strong>alt=""</strong>&gt;
  </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In the following example, a rating is shown as three filled
  stars and two empty stars. While the text alternative could have
  been "★★★☆☆", the author has
  instead decided to more helpfully give the rating in the form "3
  out of 5". That is the text alternative of the first image, and the
  rest have empty <code>alt</code> attributes.</p>
  <p><img alt="3 out of 5." height="30" src="images/rating.png" width="149"></p>

  <pre>  &lt;p&gt;Rating: &lt;meter max=5 value=3&gt;

  If an <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element has a <code>usemap</code> attribute which references a <code><a href="#the-map-element">map</a></code> element containing
  <code><a href="#the-area-element">area</a></code> elements that have <code>href</code> attributes, the <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> is considered to be interactive content.
  In such cases, always provide a text alternative for the image using the <code>alt</code> attribute.<p></p>
<div class="example">

   <p>Consider the following image which is a map of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katoomba,_New_South_Wales">Katoomba</a>,
   it has 2 interactive regions corresponding to the areas of North and South Katoomba:</p>

   <p>The text alternative is a brief description of the image. The <code>alt</code> attribute on each

  <p class="note">Generally, <a href="#image-map">image maps</a> should be
  used instead of slicing an image for links.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, when you create a composite picture from multiple images, you may wish to

  for each linked image to describe the purpose of the link.

  <div class="example">
  <p>In the following example, a composite picture is used to represent a "crocoduck"; a fictional creature which
  defies evolutionary principles by being part crocodile and part duck. You are asked to interact with the

  <p>Images of pictures or graphics include visual representations of objects, people, scenes, abstractions, etc.
  This <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#non-text-contentdef">non-text content</a>, <a href="#refsWCAG">[WCAG]</a> can convey a significant amount of
  information visually or provide a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#sensoryexpdef">specific sensory experience</a>, <a href="#refsWCAG">[WCAG]</a> to
  a sighted person. Examples include photographs, paintings, drawings and artwork.</p>

  <p>An appropriate text alternative for a picture is a brief description, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#namedef">name</a> <a href="#refsWCAG">[WCAG]</a>. As in all text alternative authoring decisions, writing suitable text alternatives for pictures requires
  human judgment. The text value is subjective to the context where the image is used and the page author's writing style. Therefore,
  there is no single 'right' or 'correct' piece of <code>alt</code> text for any particular image. In  addition to providing a short text
  alternative that gives a brief description of the non-text content, also providing supplemental content through another means when
  appropriate may be useful.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>This first example shows an image uploaded to a photo-sharing site. The photo is of a cat, sitting in the bath. The image has a
  text alternative provided using the <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element's <code>alt</code> attribute. It also has a caption provided by including
  the <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element in a <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code> element and using a <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> element to identify the caption text.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>This example is of an image that defies a complete description, as the subject of the image is open to interpretation.

  <h6 id="webcam-images">Webcam images</h6>

  <p>Webcam images are static images that are automatically updated periodically. Typically the images are
  from a fixed viewpoint, the images may update on the page automatically as each new image is uploaded from
  the camera or the user may be required to refresh the page to view an updated image. Examples include traffic
  and weather cameras.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>This example is fairly typical; the title and a time stamp are included in the image, automatically generated
  by the webcam software. It would be better if the text information was not included in the image, but as it is part
  of the image, include it as part of the text alternative. A caption is also provided using the <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code>
  and <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> elements.  As the image is provided to give a visual indication of the current weather near a building,
  a link to a local weather forecast is provided, as with automatically generated and uploaded webcam images it may be impractical to
  provide such information as a text alternative.</p>

  <p>The text of the <code>alt</code> attribute includes a prose version of the timestamp, designed to make the text more
  understandable when announced by text to speech software.  The text alternative also includes a description of some aspects
  of what can be seen in the image which are unchanging, although weather conditions and time of day change.</p>

  <h6 id="when-a-text-alternative-is-not-available-at-the-time-of-publication">When a text alternative is not available at the time of publication</h6>

  <p>In some cases an image is included in a published document, but the author is unable to provide an appropriate text alternative.
  In such cases the minimum requirement is to provide a caption for the image using the <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code> and <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code>
  elements under the following conditions:</p>

  <ul id="figcaption-as-alt-condition">
  <li>The <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element is in a <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code> element
  </li><li>The <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code> element contains a <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> element
  </li><li>The <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> element contains content other than inter-element whitespace
  </li><li>Ignoring the <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> element and its descendants, the <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code>
  element has no <code><a href="#text-0">Text</a></code> node descendants other than inter-element whitespace, and no
  embedded content descendant other than the <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element.
  </li></ul>

  <p class="note">In other words, the only content of the <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code> is an <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element and a <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code>
  element, and the <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> element must include (caption) content.</p>
  <p class="note">Such cases are to be kept to an absolute
    minimum. If there is even the slightest possibility of the author
    having the ability to provide real alternative text, then it would
    not be acceptable to omit the <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code>
    attribute.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In this example, a person uploads a photo, as part of a bulk upoad of many images, to a photo sharing site. The user has not
  provided a text alternative or a caption for the image. The site's authoring tool inserts a caption automatically using whatever useful
  information it has for the image. In this case it's the file name and date the photo was taken.</p>
  <p class="warning">The caption text in the example below is not a suitable text alternative and is not conforming to the Web Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. <a href="#refsWCAG">[WCAG]</a></p>
  <p><img alt="no text alternative provided" height="258" src="images/clara.png" width="300"></p>

  &lt;figcaption&gt;<strong>clara.jpg, taken on 12/11/2010.</strong>&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>Notice that even in this example, as much useful information
    as possible is still included in the <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> element.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>In this second example, a person uploads a photo to a photo sharing site. She has provided
  a caption for the image but not a text alternative. This may be because the site does not provide users with the ability
  to add a text alternative in the <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>

  <p><img alt="no text alternative provided" height="250" src="images/elo.png" width="205"></p>
  <p><strong>Eloisa with Princess Belle</strong></p>

  <pre>  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="elo.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;<strong>Eloisa with Princess Belle</strong>&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  </pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>Sometimes the entire point of the image is that a textual
  description is not available, and the user is to provide the
  description. For example, software that displays images and
  asks for alternative text precisely for the purpose of then
  writing a page with correct alternative text. Such a page could
  have a table of images, like this:</p>

  <pre>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt; Image &lt;th&gt; Description&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="2421.png"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Image 640 by 100, filename 'banner.gif'&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;input name="alt2421"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="2422.png"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Image 200 by 480, filename 'ad3.gif'&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;input name="alt2422"&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;</pre>

  </div>

  <p class="note">Since some users cannot use images at all (e.g. because they are blind) the
  <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute is only allowed to be omitted when no text
  alternative is available and none can be made available, as in the above examples.</p>

  <p class="auth">Generally authors should avoid using <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> elements

  <p>If an <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element is being used for purposes other
  than showing an image, e.g. as part of a service to count page

  <div class="example">
  <p>An example of an <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element used to collect web page statistics.

  <p class="note">It is recommended for the example use above the <code><a href="#attr-dim-width">width</a></code> and
  <code><a href="#attr-dim-height">height</a></code> attributes  be set to zero.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>Another example use is when an image such as a <i>spacer.gif</i> is used to aid positioning of content.

  <pre>  &lt;img src="spacer.gif" width="10" height="10" <strong>alt=""</strong>&gt;

  <h6 id="icon-images">Icon Images</h6>

  <p>An icon is usually a simple picture representing a program, action, data file or a concept.
  Icons are intended to help users of visual browsers to recognize features at a glance.</p>

  <p>Use an empty <code>alt</code> attribute when an icon is supplemental to
  text conveying the same meaning.</p>

 <div class="example">
 <p>In this example, we have a link pointing to a site's home page, the link contains a
 house icon image and the text "home". The image has an empty <code>alt</code> text.
 Where images are used in this way, it would also be appropriate to add the image using CSS</p>

  <p><img alt="A house icon next to the word 'home'." height="38" src="images/home.png" width="100"></p>

  <pre>  &lt;a href="home.html"&gt;&lt;img src="home.gif" width="15" height="15" <strong>alt=""</strong>&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>

  <pre>  #home:before
  {
  content: url(home.png);
  }

  &lt;a href="home.html" id="home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>
 </div>

 <div class="example">
 <p>In this example, there is a warning message, with a warning icon. The word "Warning!" is in emphasized
 text next to the icon. As the information conveyed by the icon is redundant the <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element is given an an empty <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>

 <p><img alt="Warning!" height="34" src="images/warning.png" width="38"> <strong>Warning!</strong> Your session is about to expire.</p>

  <pre>  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="warning.png" width="15" height="15" <strong>alt=""</strong>&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Warning!&lt;/strong&gt;
  Your session is about to expire&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
 </div>

 <p>When an icon conveys additional information not available in text, provide a text alternative.</p>

 <div class="example">
 <p>In this example, there is a warning message, with a warning icon. The icon emphasizes the
 importance of the message and identifies it as a particular type of content.</p>
 <p><img alt="Warning!" height="34" src="images/warning.png" width="38"> <strong>Your session is about to expire.</strong></p>

  <h6 id="logos,-insignia,-flags,-or-emblems">Logos, insignia, flags, or emblems</h6>
  <p>Many pages include logos, insignia, flags, or emblems, which stand for a company, organization, project,
  band, software package, country, or other entity. What can be considered as an appropriate text alternative depends upon,
  like all images, the context in which the image is being used and what function it serves in the given context.</p>

  <p>If a logo is the sole content of a link, provide a brief description of the link target in the <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>
  <div class="example">
  <p>This example illustrates the use of the HTML5 logo as the sole content of a link to the HTML specification.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/">
  <img alt="HTML 5.1 Nightly specification" height="128" src="images/HTML5_Logo.png" width="128"></a></p>

  &lt;img src="HTML5_Logo.png" <strong>alt="HTML 5.1 specification"</strong>&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>If a logo is being used to represent the entity, e.g. as a page heading, provide the name of the
  entity being represented by the logo as the text alternative.</p>
  <div class="example">
  <p>This example illustrates the use of the WebPlatform.org logo being used to represent itself.</p>
  <p><img alt="WebPlatform.org" height="100" src="images/logo-with-text.png" width="110"> and other developer resources</p>

  <pre>  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;img src="images/webplatform.png" <strong>alt="WebPlatform.org"</strong>&gt; and other developer resources&lt;h2&gt;
  </pre>
  <p class="note">The text alternative in the example above could also include the word "logo" to describe the type of image content.
  If so, it is suggested that square brackets be used to delineate this information: <code>alt="[logo] WebPlatform.org"</code>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>If a logo is being used next to the name of the what that it represents, then the logo is supplemental.
  Include an empty <code>alt</code> attribute as the text alternative is already provided.</p>

  <div class="example">
  <p>This example illustrates the use of a logo next to the name of the organization it represents.</p>
  <p><img alt="" height="68" src="images/webplatform.png" width="72"> WebPlatform.org</p>
  <pre>  &lt;img src="images/webplatform1.png" <strong>alt=""</strong>&gt; WebPlatform.org
  </pre>

  </div>
  <p>If the logo is used alongside text discussing the subject or entity the logo represents, then provide
  a text alternative which describes the logo.</p>

  <div class="example">

  <p style="width:30em;"><strong>HTML5</strong> is a language for structuring and presenting content for the World
    Wide Web, a core technology of the Internet. It is the latest revision of the HTML standard
   (originally created in 1990 and most recently standardized as HTML4 in 1997) and currently remains
   under development. Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest
   multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
   devices (web browsers, parsers etc.). </p>

  <h6 id="captcha-images">CAPTCHA Images</h6>
  <p>CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart".
  CAPTCHA images are used for security purposes to confirm that content is being accessed by a person
  rather than a computer. This authentication is done through visual verification of an image. CAPTCHA
  typically presents an image with characters or words in it that the user is to re-type. The image is
  usually distorted and has some noise applied to it to make the characters difficult to read.</p>

  <p>To improve the accessibility of CAPTCHA provide text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the image, and provide alternative
  forms of the CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception. For instance provide
  an audio alternative along with the visual image. Place the audio option right next to the visual one.
  This helps but is still problematic for people without sound cards, the deaf-blind, and some people with limited hearing.
  Another method is to include a form that asks a question along with the visual image. This helps but can be
  problematic for people with cognitive impairments.</p>
  <p class="note">It is strongly recommended that alternatives to CAPTCHA be used, as all forms of CAPTCHA introduce
  unacceptable barriers to entry for users with disabilities. Further information is available in
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>.</p>
  <div class="example">
  <p>This example shows a CAPTCHA test which uses a distorted image of text. The text alternative in the
  <code>alt</code> attribute provides instructions for a user in the case where she cannot access the image content. </p>
  <p><img alt="captcha containing the words 'aides' and 'sprucest'. The letters are distorted and the color of the letters and background is partially inverted," height="60" src="images/captcha.png" width="270"></p>
  <p><strong>Example code:</strong></p>
  <pre>&lt;img src="captcha.png" <strong>alt="If you cannot view this image an audio challenge is provided."</strong>&gt;
  &lt;!-- audio CAPTCHA option that allows the user to listen and type the word --&gt;
  &lt;!-- form that asks a question --&gt;

  <p>The <code><a href="#the-picture-element">picture</a></code> element and any <code><a href="#the-source-element">source</a></code> elements it contains have no semantics for users,
  only the <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element or its text alternative is displayed to users. Provide a text alternative for an
  <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element without regard to it being within a <code><a href="#the-picture-element">picture</a></code> element. Refer to
  <a href="#alt">Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images</a> for more information on how to provide
  useful <code>alt</code> text for images.</p>
  <p class="note"><a href="#art-direction">Art directed</a> images that rely on <code><a href="#the-picture-element">picture</a></code> need to depict
  the same content (irrespective of size, pixel density, or any other discriminating factor). Therefore the appropriate
  text alternative for an image will always be the same irrespective of which source file ends up being chosen by the browser.</p>

   <div class="example">

<pre>&lt;h2&gt;Is it a ghost?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
  &lt;source <strong>media="(min-width: 32em)"</strong> srcset="large.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;img src="small.jpg" alt="Reflection of a girls face in a train window."&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;</pre>
<p>The large and small versions (both versions are displayed for demonstration purposes) of
the image portray the same scene: Reflection of a girls face in a train window,
while the small version (displayed on smaller screens) is cropped, this does not effect the subject matter
or the appropriateness of the <code>alt</code> text.</p>
<p><img alt="Reflection of a girls face in a train window." height="315" src="images/face_large.png" width="300"> <img alt="Reflection of a girls face in a train window." height="237" src="images/face_small.png" width="228"></p>

  <h6 id="guidance-for-markup-generators">Guidance for markup generators</h6>

  <p>Markup generators (such as WYSIWYG authoring tools) should,
  wherever possible, obtain a text alternative from their
  users. However, it is recognized that in many cases, this will not
  be possible.</p>

  <p>For images that are the sole contents of links, markup generators
  should examine the link target to determine the title of the target,
  or the URL of the target, and use information obtained in this
  manner as the text alternative.</p>

  <!-- WHATWG recommend use of @title this is bad for usability and accessibility -->
  <p>For images that have captions, markup generators should use the
  <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code> and <code><a href="#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a></code> elements to provide the
  image's caption.</p>
    <p>As a last resort, implementors should either set the <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute to the empty string, under
  the assumption that the image is a purely decorative image that
  doesn't add any information but is still specific to the surrounding
  content, or omit the <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute
  altogether, under the assumption that the image is a key part of the
  content.</p>

  <p>Markup generators may specify a <dfn id="attr-img-generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt"><code>generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code></dfn>
  attribute on <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> elements for which they have been
  unable to obtain a text alternative and for which they have therefore
  omitted the <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute. The
  value of this attribute must be the empty string. Documents
  containing such attributes are not conforming, but conformance
  checkers will <a href="#guidance-for-conformance-checkers">silently
  ignore</a> this error.</p>

  <p class="note">This is intended to avoid markup generators from
  being pressured into replacing the error of omitting the <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute with the even more
  egregious error of providing phony text alternatives, because
  state-of-the-art automated conformance checkers cannot distinguish
  phony text alternatives from correct text alternatives.</p>

  <p>Markup generators should generally avoid using the image's own
  file name as the text alternative. Similarly, markup generators
  should avoid generating text alternatives from any content that will
  be equally available to presentation user agents (e.g. Web
  browsers).</p>

  <p class="note">This is because once a page is generated, it will
  typically not be updated, whereas the browsers that later read the
  page can be updated by the user, therefore the browser is likely to
  have more up-to-date and finely-tuned heuristics than the markup
  generator did when generating the page.</p>

  <h6 id="guidance-for-conformance-checkers">Guidance for conformance checkers</h6>

  <p>A conformance checker must report the lack of an <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute as an error unless one of
  the conditions listed below applies:</p>

  <ul>

   <!-- when editing this list, search for the two other occurrences
   of 'critical-no-alt' -->

   <li><p>The <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element is in a <code><a href="#the-figure-element">figure</a></code>
   element that satisfies <a href="#figcaption-as-alt-condition">the
   conditions described above</a>.</p></li>

<!--TITLE-->

   <!-- the following are additional entries not included in the
   aforementioned list, as they apply only to conformance checkers -->


   <li><p>The <code><a href="#the-img-element">img</a></code> element has a (non-conforming) <code><a href="#attr-img-generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt">generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</a></code>
   attribute whose value is the empty string. A conformance checker
   that is not reporting the lack of an <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute as an error must also not
   report the presence of the empty <code><a href="#attr-img-generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt">generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</a></code>
   attribute as an error. (This case does not represent a case where
   the document is conforming, only that the generator could not
   determine appropriate alternative text — validators are not
   required to show an error in this case, because such an error might
   encourage markup generators to include bogus alternative text
   purely in an attempt to silence validators. Naturally, conformance
   checkers <em>may</em> report the lack of an <code><a href="#attr-img-alt">alt</a></code> attribute as an error even in the
   presence of the <code><a href="#attr-img-generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt">generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</a></code>
   attribute; for example, there could be a user option to report
   <em>all</em> conformance errors even those that might be the more
   or less inevitable result of using a markup generator.)</p></li>
