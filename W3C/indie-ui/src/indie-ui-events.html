			<p>IndieUI: Events 1.0 is an abstraction between physical, device-specific user interaction events and inferred user intent such as scrolling or changing values. This provides an intermediate layer between device- and modality-specific user interaction events, and the basic user interface functionality used by web applications. IndieUI: Events focuses on granular user interface interactions such as scrolling the view, canceling an action, changing the value of a user input widget, selecting a range, placing focus on an object, etc. Implementing platforms will combine modality-specific user input, user idiosyncratic heuristics to determine the specific corresponding Indie UI event, and send that to the web application in addition to the modality-specific input such as mouse or keyboard events, should applications wish to process it.</p>

		<!-- :::::::::::::::::::: INTRO :::::::::::::::::::: -->
		<section id="intro" class="informative">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
			<section id="intro-background">
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Scripting usable interfaces can be difficult, especially when one considers that user interface design patterns differ across software platforms, hardware devices, and locales, and that those interactions can be further customized based on personal preference. Individuals are accustomed to the way the interface works on their own system, and their preferred interface frequently differs from that of the web application author's preferred interface.</p>
				<p class="note">In order to greatly reduce scope and achievability for a 1.0 release, the IndieUI working group agreed to remove continuous events such as the <code>zoomrequest</code> event listed in the intro.</p>
				<p class="ednote">Editorial note: Need to rewrite the intro to use an example that is in scope for 1.0.</p>
				<p>For example, web application authors, wishing to intercept a user's intent to "zoom in" on a custom image viewer or map view, need to "listen" for all of the following events:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><kbd>Control+PLUS</kbd> on Windows and Linux.</li>
					<li><kbd>Command+PLUS</kbd> on Mac OS X.</li>
					<li>Scroll events initiated by a trackpad or mouse scroll wheel.</li>
					<li>Multiple touch or pointer events on some devices.</li>
					<li>Additional gestures or speech commands on implementations that may not currently be detectable.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In addition to the general user interface challenges, custom interfaces often don't take into account users who access web content via assistive technologies that use alternate forms of input such as screen readers, switch interfaces, or speech-based command and control interfaces.</p>
				<p>It would be simpler to listen for a normalized request to "zoom in" on the current view, whereby the web application could determine the new scale factor and update its custom view accordingly. Whether through continuous physical events like a scroll wheel or discrete physical events like the keyboard shortcuts, a user could indicate his intent to "zoom in" and the web application author would only need to listen for a single type of event: <code>zoomrequest</code>.</p>
				<p>IndieUI Events defines a way for web authors to register for these <em>request events</em> on a leaf node element or on a ancestor element acting as an event delegate. Authors also declaritively define which actions or behaviors a view responds to, and when it is appropriate for browsers to initiate these events.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="intro-goals" class="informative">
				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>The primary goals of the Events Module specification are declared as the following:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Make it easier for web developers to author consistently usable interfaces that are input-agnostic and independent of a user's particular platform, hardware, locale, and preferences.</li>
					<li>Enable every type of control in these interfaces to be programmatically determinable and controllable by both mainstream and alternate forms of user input.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The IndieUI Working Group also hopes to provide a clear path for web developers to smoothly transition from currently existing physical events to IndieUI events, during the period when implementations of IndieUI are incomplete. This will likely be achieved through polyfill implementations in common JavaScript libraries, though such implementations are not a required deliverable of the IndieUI Working Group, and documentation of this development path is not a requirement of this Events Module specification.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="intro-scope" class="informative">
				<h3>Document Scope</h3>
				<p>Decisions regarding which specific physical user interactions (keyboard combinations, gestures, speech, etc.) initiate IndieUI events are explicitly listed as out-of-scope in the Working Group charter. User interface interaction patterns should be designed and defined by each operating system, rather than defined as part of any technical specification.</p>
				<p>However, this document lists informative examples of certain keyboard and mouse events that <em>may</em> initiate each IndieUI event. They are listed here purely to aid in clarifying the reader's conceptual understanding of each event, as well as illustrating certain UI differences between platforms. These informative examples are primarily limited to keyboard and mouse events, because those physical modalities have been common in software interaction for decades, and their use is familiar to most readers.</p>
				<p>For example, it may be common for the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key to trigger a "dismissrequest" event to close a dialog on most systems, but the specification does not require the user agent to use any particular physical event. It is an implementation detail, and left for the developers of each platform or assistive technology to determine whether <kbd>ESC</kbd> or some other interaction is the most appropriate way to initiate the "dismissrequest" event. As long as there is a documented way for end users to initiate each event, the user agent will be considered a conforming implementation.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="intro-usage">
				<h3>Usage Examples</h3>
				
				<section id="intro-example-dismissrequest">
					<h4>Dismissing a Modal Dialog</h4>
					<p>The following example uses a "dismissrequest" event to close or cancel out of a modal application dialog.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight">
						&lt;!-- Declare which IndieUI event(s) this element receives. --&gt;
						&lt;dialog <strong>uiactions="dismiss"</strong> id="myDialog"&gt;
						  &lt;!-- Include an optional click trigger for the dismiss action. --&gt;
						  &lt;button <strong>uitrigger="dismiss"</strong>&gt; Cancel &lt;/button&gt;
						  ... other dialog contents ...
						&lt;/dialog&gt;

						&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

						  var myDialog = document.getElementById("myDialog");

						  // At some point during runtime, the handler will be called.
						  // For example, if the user presses ESC key while focus is inside the dialog.
						  function dismissHandler(e) {

						    // Cancel and close the dialog. Don't forget to move focus before closing.
						    closeDialog(<strong>e.receiver</strong>); // Event.receiver is a readonly property like Event.target

						    // Then cancel the event.
						    e.stopPropagation(); // Stop the event from bubbling.
						    <strong>e.preventDefault();</strong> // Let the UA/AT know the event was intercepted successfully.

						  }

						  // Register the event at initialization.
						  // Either on the receiver itself, or on an ancestor element like the body. 
						  <strong>myDialog.addEventListener("dismissrequest", dismissHandler);</strong>

						&lt;/script&gt;

			<section id="intro-backwards-compatibility" class="informative">
				<h3>Backwards-Compatibility</h3>
				<p>One of the core principles behind <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> Change Request Events is that they operate on a backwards-compatible, opt-in basis. In other words, the web application author has to first be aware of these events, then explicitly declare each event receiver and register an event listener, or user agents behave as normal and do not initiate these events.</p>
				<p>Change request events do not cause any direct manipulation or mutation of the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>, and do not have any "default action" in the context of a web view. Instead, the event conveys the user's intent to the web application, and allows the web application to perform the appropriate action on behalf of the user, including making potential changes to the DOM. If a web application is authored to understand the change request event, it can cancel the event, which informs the user agent that the event has been captured and understood. If a web application does not cancel the event, the user agent may attempt fallback behavior or communicate to the user that the input has not been recognized.</p>

"click" behavior) is to initiate a <em>discrete</em> <a href="#UIRequestEvent">UIRequestEvent</a> for the current element or an ancestor element. For example, a "close" or "back" button of a dialog would trigger a "dismiss" request, and a "move to trash" button would trigger a "delete" request.</p>
			<p>In order to define a trigger element, authors MUST set the value of the <a href="#uitrigger-attribute">uitrigger</a> attribute as a single token value corresponding to an action defined on the current or an ancestor node. User agents MUST NOT initiate a request Event from a trigger element unless the corresponding action is defined on the current element or an ancester element using the <a href="#uiactions-content-attribute"><code>uiactions</code> content attribute</a> or <a href="#uiactions-attribute"><code>uiactions</code> IDL attribute</a>.</p>
			<p>Web authors MUST ensure trigger elements have an appropriate accessible label, as rendered text or a text alternative. Web authors MUST ensure trigger elements use an appropriate implicit or explicit role (usually <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/complete#button"><code>button</code></a>).</p>
			<p>Web authors SHOULD ensure trigger elements are focusable. Web authors MAY forego making a trigger element focusable if the trigger provides redundant functionality already available through another physical interface. For example, a "delete" trigger may not need to be focusable if pressing the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key triggers the same request event.</p>

								<p>Users, wanting to "escape from" or "dismiss" a web application state (for example, closing a modal dialog), can indicate their intent a number of ways, most commonly by pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd> on keyboard-controlled operating systems. Web authors who have registered for this event should process the event to determine whether to cancel the event. If the "dismiss" action is understood in the context of the web application, web authors should perform the appropriate action (such as closing the dialog), and cancel the event using the event object's <code>preventDefault()</code> method.</p>

			<h2>Substantive, normative changes since the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-indie-ui-events-20150430/#changelog">last public working draft</a></h2>
			<ul>
				<li><del>18-Aug-2013: Enum constants formerly defined in UIScrollRequestEvent, UIValueChangeRequestEvent, and UIFocusRequestEvent have been changed to WebIDL enumeration identifier strings. (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/IndieUI/track/actions/64">ACTION-64</a>)</del></li>
				<li>18-Aug-2013: Event initializer dictionaries (<a href="#UIRequestEventInit">UIRequestEventInit</a>, <del>UIFocusRequestEventInit</del>) were missing inheritance declarations in the IDL.</li>
				<li>22-Aug-2013: <a href="#feature-detection">Feature detection section</a> recommends direct object detection now rather than using DOMImplementation.hasFeature().</li>
				<li><del>5-Mar-2014: Added continuous events for Manipulation Requests (zoom, pan, move, rotate) as well as for Scroll Requests.</del></li>
				<li>15-May-2014: New <a href="#triggers">UI Triggers</a> section.</li>
				<li><del>16-May-2014: New UI Manipulators section (partial).</del></li>
				<li>15-April-2015: Based on discussion in the Working Group call today, we've gutted much of the spec to greatly reduce scope for a 1.0 heartbeat draft. Removed all actions associated with continuous events, such as zoom, scroll, value change, etc. Removed UI Manipulators section because it's also associated with continuous events. Removed focus request events because they were somewhat abstract and confusing to authors. The primary remaining features are the simplest of the discrete events, such as dismiss, delete, and the media events (play, pause, etc.) Implementations were previously stalled due to complexities of continuous events, and the working group believes implementation is now readily achievable with this greatly reduced scope.</li>
