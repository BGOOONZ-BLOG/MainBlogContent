Welcome to the Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group (SDWIG)!

From the group's [home page][1] you can find pointers to relevant resources, including our meeting schedule. Please review the [Charter][2], note the group's prior discussions are available via the [mailing list archive][3], and see [our Projects list in Github][12] as a starting point for an overview of the group's ongoing work. Our [Github repository][4] itself is where we store our work items and record issues. Our group operates under the W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct][13].

Please note that the original [Spatial Data on the Web Working Group][5] closed in 2017, this was then an Interest Group; the Working Group was re-chartered in 2021. Some of the material in this repository was initially developed and published by the original Working Group. The Working Group published several Recommendations and Notes you are encouraged to read (if you have not already done so). These are all listed on the landing page of our [Github repository][4], which also states how to provides comments.

To get acquainted with our activities we invite you to look at our current work items. These can be found in the previously mentioned [Projects list in Github][12]. We are currently actively working on [maintenance and ways to encourage adoption][6] of the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices and several other work items. There is also ongoing maintenance of SOSA/SSN as well as OWL Time, the two Recommendations published by the previous working group. Our charter also mentions other work items, but work on these has not started. Please let us know if you are interested in those!

In addition, we are vetting new possible standardization items related to spatial data and the web. We are using the [W3C strategy funnel][10] for this. Items we are looking at are tagged ['geospatial'][11]. One of the things this group does is recommend where these items should be standardized (W3C or OGC or both). 

Most work takes place in our [GitHub repository][4] which has subfolders for the different work items (it was used for the former Working Group as well as the current Interest Group). Feel free to create or respond to Github issues. You may also always send your feedback to the group's [mailing list][3] that is used for technical discussions. The mailing list is automatically notified of relevant activity in GitHub.

We have regular, monthly teleconferences, the schedule of which is available on our [home page][1]. These teleconferences are basically used to touch base and track the progress of work. For more in-depth discussions and cooperation we use Github, the mailing list, face to face meetings (when we can!), as well as extra ad hoc teleconferences if we need them. 

To summarize the key resources:

* [Home page][1] - contains pointers to the group's resources, such as:
* [Charter][2] - goals, scope, deliverables, patent policy
* [Mailing list][3] - public archived mailing list for technical discussions
* [Github repository][4] - the Github repository where all our work is managed
* [Funnel][11] - possible new standardization items we are vetting 

Please feel free to introduce yourself on the mailing list, share your interests toward the Interest Group, and areas where you might want to contribute. Also, please do not hesitate to contact us, Bert Bos (the W3C team contact for the group) and Scott Simmons (the OGC team contact for the group) if you have any questions.

Please look at our meeting schedule for our next face to face meeting. You are invited!

Looking forward to working with you!

Thanks,

Linda & Jeremy (SDWIG Chairs)
