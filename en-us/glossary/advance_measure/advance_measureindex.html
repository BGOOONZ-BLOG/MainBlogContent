<p>The <strong>advance measure</strong> of a glyph is its <em>advance width</em> or <em>advance height</em>, whichever is in the inline axis of the element.</p>
<p>This term is used in the definition of a number of CSS {{cssxref(“&lt;length&gt;”)}} units. For example, <code>ch</code> is the <em>advance measure</em> of the “0” character in the given typeface. For a horizontal inline axis, this will be the width of the character.</p>
