<p>{{SeeCompatTable}}{{APIRef()}}</p>
<p>The <strong><code>UIEvent.sourceCapabilities</code></strong> read-only property returns an instance of the {{domxref(‘InputDeviceCapabilities’)}} interface which provides information about the physical device responsible for generating a touch event. If no input device was responsible for the event, it returns <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>When a single user interaction with an input device generates a series of different input events, the <code>sourceCapabilities</code> property for all of them will point to the same instance of <code>InputDeviceCapabilities</code>. For example, when a user lifts their finger off of a touchscreen, several UIEvents may be generated including <code>touchend</code>, <code>mousedown</code>, <code>click</code>, and <code>focus</code>. All of these events must have the same <code>sourceCapabilities</code> representing the touchscreen.</p>
<p>A device is considered “responsible” for an event only when that interaction is part of the abstraction provided by the web platform. For example, many user agents allow a window to be resized with a mouse or a keyboard, but this detail is not exposed to the web platform in any way, and so the sourceCapabilities of a resize event will typically be null.</p>
