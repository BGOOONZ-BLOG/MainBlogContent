<div id="goals">
<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The Devices and Sensors Working Group produces Web client-side APIs that allow Web applications to
  access advanced capabilities of their host devices.</p>

<p>These capabilities include access to cameras, microphones, and system information such as network
  connection and battery level.</p>

<p>Adding these advanced features to the Web environment empowers Web developers to create richer and
  more context-aware Web applications.</p>

<p>These APIs grant access to sensitive data, some of which is not
  intuitively obvious as being sensitive, and some of which can be used
  to track users.  Because of that, these APIs
  must be both secure and privacy-enabling by design, based on the current Web browser security
  model. When existing browser-based privacy and security metaphors apply, the WG will endeavour
  to reuse them. When those metaphors do not apply, the WG will explore innovative security and
  privacy mechanisms.</p>
</div>

<div class="scope">
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>The scope of this Working Group is the creation of API specifications for a
deviceâ€™s services that can be exposed to Web applications. Services include sensors, media capture, network information and discovery. Devices in this context include desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile Internet devices (MIDs), cellular phones, TVs, cameras and other connected devices.</p>

<p>Hardware security services are out of scope for this group.</p>

<p>Priority will be given to developing simple and consensual APIs, leaving
more complex features to future versions.</p>

<h3>Success Criteria</h3>

<p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification must
  have two independent implementations of all defined features, at least one of which is
  on a constrained device such as a mobile phone or TV.</p>

<p>Comprehensive test suites will be developed for each specification to ensure interoperability,
  and the group will create interoperability reports. The group will also maintain errata as
  required for the continued relevance and usefulness of the specifications it produces. </p>

<p>Each specification must contain a section on accessibility that describes the
  benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address
  them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>

<p>Each specification must detail all known security and privacy implications for
  implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

<p>APIs that cannot be demonstrated to be implementable securely within the default browser
  context will not be released.</p>

<p>The specifications produced by this WG must mitigate disclosure of data when possible
  and seek meaningful user consent in other cases.  If the WG decides that one or more of
  its specifications cannot be usefully implemented while simultaneously allowing users to
  meaningfully consent to the use of sensitive data, it should not advance those
  specifications.</p>

</div>

<div class="deliverables">
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<p>The Devices and Sensors WG will follow a
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">test as you
commit</a> approach to specification development, for specifications in CR or
above.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">
  <p>All normative spec changes are generally expected to have a corresponding pull request in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests">web-platform-tests</a>, either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the proposed update.</p>

  <p>Typically, both pull requests (spec updates and tests) will be merged at the same time. If a pull request for the specification is approved but the other needs more work, add the '<a href="https://w3c.github.io/spec-labels.html" rel="nofollow">needs tests</a>' label or, in web-platform-tests, the '<a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3Astatus%3Aneeds-spec-decision%20">status:needs-spec-decision</a>' label. Note that a test change that contradicts the specification should not be merged before the corresponding specification change.</p>

  <p>If testing is not practical due to web-platforms-tests limitations, please explain why and if appropriate file an issue with the '<a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=label%3Atype%3Auntestable%20">type:untestable</a>' label to follow up later.</p>

    <p><strong>Draft State:</strong> <a href="https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/">Adopted from WICG</a> (see also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/netinfo-api/">Working Group Note</a> that predates the WICG Draft Report)</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Maintenance</h4>
<p>The Working Group will maintain errata and new editions, as necessary, for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-geolocation-API-20161108/">Geolocation API</a>, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-vibration-20161018/">Vibration API</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-html-media-capture-20180201/">HTML Media Capture</a> W3C Recommendations.</p>

<p>Where practical, the API specifications should use the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/">Web IDL</a> formalism.</p>

<h4>Jointly Developed Specifications</h4>

<p>The Working Group may also enter into joint Task Forces with other groups to collaborate on any of the above Deliverables that cross group boundaries.</p>

<h3>Adding new Recommendation-track deliverables</h3>

<p>If additional in-scope Recommendation-track deliverables need to be added to the Charter before the Charter expires, the Working Group will prepare an updated Charter that differs only in deliverables.</p>

<p>The Working Group will not adopt new proposals until they have matured through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a> or another similar incubation phase.</p>

<h3>Other Deliverables</h3>

<p>A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is necessary
to ensure the specificationâ€™s robustness, consistency, and implementability,
and to promote interoperability between User Agents.</p>

<p>The Working Group may also document in a Working Group Note useful
design patterns shared by the APIs it is developing.</p>

<p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as:</p>

<div id="ig-other-deliverables">
<ul>
  <li>Primers</li>
  <li>Requirements and use case documents for specifications</li>
  <li>Non-normative group notes</li>
</ul>

<p>Given sufficient resources, this Working Group should review other working
groupsâ€™ deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
Groupâ€™s mission. </p>

<h2 id="coordination">Coordination</h2>

<h3>W3C Groups</h3>

<p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#first-wd">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months before <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#candidate-rec">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.

  <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Application Security Working Group</a></dt>
<dd>The Web Application Security Working Group is developing guidance on APIs that expose sensitive information, and an API to manage permissions, both of which matter to several of this group specifications.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/">Web Platform
  Working Group</a></dt>
    <dd>This group defines relevant specifications including <cite><a
      href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/">Web IDL</a></cite>, and <cite><a
      href="https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/">File API</a></cite>.</dd>
  <dt><a href="/2011/04/webrtc/">Web Real Time Communications Working Group</a></dt>
<dd>Both the Devices and Sensors and WebRTC Working Groups develop capture-related APIs.</dd>
</dl>

<div>
<h3>External Groups</h3>

<p>The following is a tentative list of external bodies the Working Group
should collaborate with: </p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm"
  id="tc39">Ecma International Technical Committee 39 (TC39)</a></dt>
    <dd>This is the group responsible for EcmaScript standardization, and
      related EcmaScript features. As this Working Group is
      developing EcmaScript APIs, it should collaborate with TC39.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.ietf.org" id="ietf">IETF</a></dt>
    <dd>The IETF has created specifications that are related to some of the
      APIs in this WGâ€™s scope.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>

<div class="participation">
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

<p>To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active
participants for its duration, and to have the participation of the industry
leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it produces. </p>

<p>The Chair(s) and specification Editors are expected to contribute one to two
days per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for
other participants.</p>

<p>Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also decide to create task forces that allow more focused discussions for topics that require specific expertise.</p>

<p>This Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for building
Test Suites for each specification. </p>

<p>The group
  encourages questions and comments on its public mailing lists  and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.</p>

<p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for
consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>. </p>
</div>

<div class="communication">
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>Technical discussions for this Working  Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.</p>

<p>Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables,
issues, actions, status, participants) is available from the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/das/">Devices and Sensors Working Group
home page</a>.</p>

<p>The Working Groupâ€™s Teleconferences focus on discussion of particular
specifications, and are conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>

<p>This group primarily conducts its technical work  on
the <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/">public-device-apis@w3.org</a> and on Github issues. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.</p>

<p>The group uses a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative
purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and participants of the group, for
Member-only discussions in special cases when a particular participant requests such
a discussion. </p>

</div>

<div class="decisions">
<h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

<p> This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>

<p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.</p>

<p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

<p>All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.</p>

<p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.</p>
</div>

<div class="patent">
<h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Policy </h2>
