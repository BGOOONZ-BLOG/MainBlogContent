The only apparent significant difference is their reference to use in protocols for exclusion of study subjects.  These concepts/codes were proposed by RCRIM for use in the CTLaboratory message.  They were submitted and approved in the November 2005 Harmonization cycle in proposal \"030103C_VOCAB_RCRIM_l_quade_RCRIM Obs Interp_20051028154455\". However, this proposal was not fully implemented in the vocabulary.  The proposal recommended creation of the x_ClinicalResearchExclusion domain in ObservationInterpretation with a value set including those three concepts/codes, but there is no subdomain of that name or equivalent with a binding to either of the value sets that contain these concepts/codes.  Members of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta, without response.
