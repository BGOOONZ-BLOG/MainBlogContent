### Draft Agenda

*   TPAC: Interesting breakouts and joint discussions.

*   Sebastian Roth, et al. will present "[12 Angry Developers: A Qualitative Study on Developersâ€™ Struggles with CSP](https://swag.cispa.saarland/files/usecsp_preprint.pdf)":
    
    > In our presentation, we will share some of our recent empirical analyses on the topic of CSP.
    > This will cover a zoom into how even top sites struggle to initially deploy a CSP,
    > understanding what technical roadblocks there are, and what our in-depth interview and coding
    > study with 12 developers has uncovered. After that, we plan to discuss potential future
    > directions for making CSP more meaningful to deploy.
