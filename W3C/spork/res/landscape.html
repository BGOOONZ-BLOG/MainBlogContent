  <p>
    This document is maintained through a relatively complex pipeline. It starts from the WHATWG
    HTML “kitchen sink” specification, drops a number of sections that are published elsewhere,
    then applies a series of transformations that implement disagreements between the HTML WG and

    It is maintained by the HTML WG.

    The details of the transformations carried out by Spork are:
