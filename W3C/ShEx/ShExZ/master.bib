		 framework for representing information in the Web. RDF
		 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax defines an abstract
		 syntax (a data model) which serves to link all
		 RDF-based languages and specifications. The abstract
		 syntax has two key data structures: RDF graphs are sets
		 of subject-predicate-object triples, where the elements
		 may be IRIs, blank nodes, or datatyped literals. They
		 are used to express descriptions of resources. RDF
		 datasets are used to organize collections of RDF
		 graphs, and comprise a default graph and zero or more
		 named graphs. This document also introduces key
		 concepts and terminology, and discusses datatyping and
		 the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within RDF
		 graphs.",
