Proposal (ok with Board):

  1. 2nd of May: WG submits Proposed Draft for Board approval
  1. No later than 23d of May: Board approval, 45 day Final Notice Period (IP Review) begins

## Working Mode ##
### Editorial fixes ###
  * Large incoming batches documented on wiki (see [Publications](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/PublicationsFeedback) and [OCF](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/OCFFeedback) for the Murata-sans team batch)
  * Smaller editorial remarks dealt with directly

### Issues ###
  1. Chair assigns an Owner, who is charged with producing a draft response
  1. If Owner feels ill suited (time- or knowledgewise) to produce draft response, notify chair who will reassign, else:
  1. draft response produced asap and sent to WG list; chair confirmation + possible additional discussions (48 hours max turnaround)
  1. response posted +  action items for spec edits distributed (where applicable)


## Major Issues (a selection) ##
_not for conclusion at this call, just a headsup/orientation + assignment_

  * [Issue 75](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=75)
