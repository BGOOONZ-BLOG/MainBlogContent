      <h1 id="title">Digital Publishing Interest Group Charter</h1>
      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DPUB/IG/">Digital Publishing
              Interest Group</a> is to provide a technical forum for experts in the digital
        publishing ecosystem to hold discussions and recommend solutions regarding a future
        vision of Digital Publishing. This Interest Group is a continuation
        of the previous Digital Publishing Interest Group whose original
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/02/digpubig.html">charter</a>
        expires in September 2015, and it adds a more general vision on the
        future of Digital Publishing to the goals to be accomplished. The Digital Publishing community represents a large community including electronic journals, magazines, news,
        standards, and book publishing (authors, creators, publishers, news
        organizations, booksellers, accessibility and internationalization
        specialists, etc.). The main
        message of that vision, which has already been discussed by the
        community, is that the current format- and workflow-level separation
        between offline/portable and online document publishing should be
        diminished to zero. While this Interest Group is not chartered to
        specify Recommendations, it will provide technical direction, identify
        technical issues, and outline prototype solutions for relevant Working
        Groups of the W3C to finalize as Web standards. Some of
        the work will have to be done in a strong cooperation with existing
        Working Groups at W3C or at IDPF to ensure a full compatibility with the
        Open Web Platform.</p>

        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>Today’s digital publishing market is dynamic, fast-changing, and
          strong. Electronic books, or eBooks, compete with printed versions,
          and there is a wide choice of hardware and software available for
          eBook readers.  Journals and magazines are also made available
          digitally on the web or in specialized applications and, in some
          cases, their printed version is abandoned in favor of a purely
          digital version. The formats used by eBook readers and tablets for
          electronic books, magazines, journals and educational resources are
          largely based on W3C technologies, such as (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL,
          MathML, or various Web APIs.</p>
        <p>The group is a continuation, under a new charter, of the Digital
          Publishing Interest Group that started in 2013 and whose original <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/2013/02/digpubig.html">charter</a> expires
          in September 2015. That group has firmly established the presence of
          the Digital Publishing Community within W3C and, vice versa, the
          presence of W3C within the Digital Publishing Community. Work started
          by that group in the area of <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/Task_Forces/Accessibility">Accessibility</a>,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/Task_Forces/Latinreq">Layout
            &amp; Styling</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/UseCase_Directory#Pagination.2FDOM_interaction">Pagination</a>,
          or <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/Task_Forces/Content_and_Markup">Content
            &amp; Markup</a>, will be continued and completed by this newly
          chartered group. The results of the earlier incarnation of this
          Interest Group will provide a strong basis for the work of this
          new Interest Group. </p>
          <p>
          Of particular interest to this group is the advancement of EPUB. <a href='http://idpf.org/epub/30'>EPUB 3</a> already ensures the introduction of highly dynamic and interactive digital documents whose features resemble more of what the Web generally provides. This can be seen through a new breed of interactive books in, for example, the educational domain. The same technical possibilities in that domain have the potential to revolutionize such diverse areas as journal and magazine publications (including scholarly journal publishing), the archiving of Web content, and in-house publishing of documentations by large corporations.
          </p>
          <p>The vision for the convergence of future of digital documents and the Web, that governs the work of this Interest Group, has also been summarized in a separate white paper entitled <a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/">“Advancing Portable Documents for the Open Web Platform: EPUB+WEB”</a> as follows:
          </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Our vision […] is that portable documents become fully native
            citizens of the Open Web Platform. In this vision, the current
            format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable […]
            and online […] document publishing is diminished to zero. These are
            merely two dynamic manifestations of the same publication: content
            authored with online use as the primary mode can easily be saved by
            the user for offline reading in portable document form. […]
            Publishers can choose to utilize either or both of these publishing
            modes, and users can choose either or both of these consumption
            modes. Essential features flow seamlessly between online and offline
            modes; examples include cross-references, user annotations, access
            to online databases, as well as licensing and rights management.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Turning this vision into reality, however, requires significant
          technical work. Some of the issues are already addressed in existing
          W3C Working Groups (e.g., the CSS, HTML5, or the Web Applications
          Working Groups) but it is very important that those activities take
          into account the use cases and requirements of the digital
          publishing industry through review responses, comments, and direct
          participation in those Working Groups. There are also a number of
          technical challenges specific to this vision that will also
          necessitate targeted specification work. A <a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/draft/#achieving-convergence-work-areas">first
            set of technical challenges</a> have been identified in the white
          paper; the most important ones are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/#arch">General Architecture for Online/Offline Publications</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/#document-and-fragment-identification">Document
              and fragment identification</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/#styling-and-layout-pagination">Styling
              and Layout, Pagination</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, it is not yet clear, at this moment, which of these (or
          other) challenges will require targeted work by this Interest Group
          and which should be done in cooperation with existing Working Groups.
          In light of this, the goal of this Interest Group is to</p>
        <ul>
          <li>provide an in-depth and exhaustive overview of the technical
            challenges that should be solved to make the EPUB+WEB vision a
            reality; and,</li>
          <li>determine, and take the necessary actions in the form of
            prototyping technical solutions or specifications, whether these
            challenges should be addressed through
          <ul>
            <li>new Working Groups at W3C, in which case the Interest Group will
              actively contribute to the chartering of those groups, or</li>
            <li>cooperation with other W3C groups (in which case the Interest
              Group will provide feedback, comments, and requirements to those
              Groups to ensure the necessary convergence, and will encourage
              members of the Interest Group to actively participate in those
              Working Groups), or</li>
            <li>the publication of non-normative documents, like Interest Group
              Notes, of prototypical technical solutions, or</li>
            <li>by Working Groups at other organizations, like the International
              Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) or the Book Industry Study Group
              (BISG), in which case strong liaisons will established with those
              groups.</li>
          </ul>
	  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to these work items, the Interest Group will also
          establish an active collaborative relationship with IDPF around
          the work on the EPUB&nbsp;3.1. This work, in discussion to be <a href="http://www.idpf.org/workplans/2015/epub31.html">chartered by IDPF</a> in 2015, aims to include a number of backward compatible
          changes to EPUB&nbsp;3.01, adding new features and deprecating others. Many
          of those changes aim at bringing EPUB even closer to the Open Web
          Platform and, thereby, contributing to the vision of EPUB+WEB. The
          Interest Group will act as an advisory group to IDPF on the OWP
          related features, as well as a conduit to other groups at W3C.</p>

        <p>Finally, the Interest Group will also plan for outreach actions aimed at bringing the Publishing Community closer to the general development of the Open Web Platform, and to attract a larger participation in the work at W3C.</p>

        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>The group has succeeded if</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the group has successfully completed the work started by the
            previous version of the Interest Group on Accessibility, Pagination,
            or Content &amp; Markup;</li>
          <li>a clear migration path towards the vision expressed in the
            EPUB+WEB White Paper has been established, including a clear view of
            the technical challenges and issues to solve;</li>
          <li>a fruitful cooperation is established between the Interest Group
            and the relevant Working Groups at W3C, reflected by a successful
            harmonization between the needs of the publishing industry at large,
            and EPUB+WEB in particular, and constituents of the Open Web
            Platform; </li>
          <li>the group has successfully contributed establishing the Working
            Group(s) essential to turn the EPUB+WEB vision a reality;</li>
          <li>members of the Interest Group join the relevant Working Groups to
            participate and possibly drive the development of the specific work
            items that are in development and are considered to be important for
            the EPUB+WEB vision;</li>
          <li>production of stable documents addressing the work items listed in
            the <a href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a> section;</li>
          <li>the Interest Group has provided useful advice and help to IDPF in
            developing EPUB 3.1; and,</li>
          <li>a productive and stable set of liaisons is set up between the
            Digital Publishing industry and its representative organizations
            like the IDPF, EDItEUR, or BISG, and the various W3C Working Groups.
            These liaisons should define how W3C Working Groups can request
            technical comments from those external organizations, and how those
            external organizations can convey their requirements to current and
            future Working Groups. These liaisons should remain active even when
            the Interest Group is closed.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
          <p>This Interest Group is not chartered to develop final
            specifications, i.e., Recommendations. That must be done in relevant
            W3C Working Groups, either pre-existing or newly chartered, with a
            direct participation of the interested parties.</p>
          <p>This Interest Group is not chartered to work on issues and use
            cases that are relevant exclusively to non-W3C standards and
            specifications (e.g., Unicode), although the evolution of those
            Specifications should be followed as they may influence the
            deliverables of this group.</p>

        <p>This is an initial list of the activities and groups the Interest
          Group will consider when starting its work. The goal of these
          liaisons is to ensure harmonization of the technical requirements
          and provide feedback. The importance of these will be evaluated
          during the lifetime of the Interest Group; this also means that
          some groups may not be contacted if the Interest Group does not
          find any issues and problems worth raising after all. The list of
          these groups, with a short description of the technical area of
          interest, includes:</p>

        <p class="note">Some of the groups listed here may change their name (e.g., “Protocols and Formats” dividing into Accessible Rich Internet Applications and Accessible Platform Architectures) or may be merged (“HTML” and “Web Applications”) by the time this charter would be approved.  The appropriate editorial changes will be made at the time this charter is approved, or shortly thereafter.</p>

          <dd>The possibility of adding and maintaining annotations on portable
            documents is crucial in some publication areas (e.g., educational
            publications or scholarly articles). The work on robust anchoring in
            that Working Group will also contribute to the Fragment Identifier

            a possible replacement of HTML as the “top level” format for
            publications like mangas. As such, SVG plays a vital role for,
            among other things, the educational publishing market, children’s
            literature, or high quality illustrations in books.</dd>

                        Workers</a>, that may form the basis of a general architecture for online/offline publications.
            Furthermore, on-line magazines and journals are increasingly dependent on
            various APIs to make their content more interactive and appealing;
            EPUB3 has also introduced the possibility to include scripts in
            electronic books, which may be important for, e.g., the educational
            market. </dd>

          <dd>Interoperability of electronic book readers is considered to be a
            major challenge by that community; cooperating with the W3C testing

          <dd>The technical work around ARIA has a direct relationship to some of the work around structural semantics in portable documents, e.g., in EPUB.  The Interest Group will provide input to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/">Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module</a> and Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings, part of the ARIA Working Group deliverables; it will also contribute to the ongoing discussions relating the Web Annotation work with ARIA&nbsp;2.0.</dd>

        <p>Participation in the Digital Publishing Interest Group is open to all
          W3C Members. Individuals who wish to participate as Invited Experts
          (i.e., they do not represent a W3C Member) should refer to the <a shape="rect"
            href="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/invexp.html">policy for approval of
            Invited Experts</a>. Invited Experts in this group are not granted
          access to Member-only information. Effective participation in the
          Interest Group is expected to consume one day work per week for each
          participant. </p>
        <p>The group may decide to create Task Forces within the Interest Group
          to concentrate on major relevant constituencies, for example
          electronic books, journal/magazine publishing, or educational
          publishing. These Task Forces may organize separate teleconferences,
          meetings, and may be responsible for one or more deliverables. </p>
        <p>There are no minimum requirements for participation in this group.
          Participants are strongly encouraged to take advantage of frequent
          opportunities to review and comment on deliverables from other groups.</p>
        <p>The Chair may call occasional meetings consistent with the <a shape="rect"

        <p>The role of <a href="#depliaisons">dependencies and liaisons</a>
          with various external groups is fundamental to the success of this
          Interest Group; the group will therefore set up active liaisons early

        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
          consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after
          due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a
          decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move
          on. <br />
          <br />
          A formal vote should allow for remote asynchronous
          participation—using, for example, email and/or web-based survey
          techniques. Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or
          teleconference is to be considered provisional until 5 working days
          after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the
          group's mailing list. </p>
        <p>If the group decides to create Task Forces, these may be responsible
          for one or more deliverables. However, final decisions are taken at
          the Interest Group level as described above.</p>
        <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">Section
            3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting
          procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>
