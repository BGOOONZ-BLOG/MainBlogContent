Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Candidate Recommendations published for Web Annotation.

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/annotation/">Web Annotation Working Group</a> has just published a Candidate Recommendation for two documents, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-model-20160705/">Web Annotation Data Model</a>—specification describes a structured model and format, in JSON, to enable annotations to be shared and reused across different hardware and software platforms. Common use cases can be modeled in a manner that is simple and convenient, while at the same time enabling more complex requirements, including linking arbitrary content to a particular data point or to segments of timed multimedia resources.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-annotation-vocab-20160705/">Web Annotation Vocabulary</a>—specifies the set of RDF classes, predicates and named entities that are used by the Web Annotation Data Model. It also lists recommended terms from other ontologies that are used in the model, and provides the JSON-LD Context and profile definitions needed to use the Web Annotation JSON serialization in a Linked Data context.</li>
</ul>


<p>Candidate Recommendation means that the Working Group considers the technical design to be complete, and is seeking implementation feedbacks on the documents. There is a separate <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-annotation-tests/blob/master/README.md">document how to use them and report on implementation results</a>. The group is keen to get comments and implementation experiences on these specifications, either as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-annotation/issues">issues on the Group’s GitHub repository</a> or by posting to <a href="mailto:public-annotation@w3.org">public-annotation@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>The group expects to satisfy the implementation goals (i.e., at least two, independent implementation for each of the test cases) by September 30, 2016.</p>
