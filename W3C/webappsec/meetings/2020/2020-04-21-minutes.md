### Minutes

[technical difficulties; apparently some sort of split between web-based webex and the phone line]


### Call forked?
Please make sure you're joining via the current meeting number available through: https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/webex.html

If you're having WebEx issues, please try dialing in via the PSTN, coordinates above.

### COOP/COEP

mkwst: keeping things brief, Google's shipping schedule. Chrome 82, the original target, is not being shipped period due to Covid chaos. Initial implementation should come out mid-ish May in 83 without having to flip any flags. the main missing piece is the reporting functionality. Hope to have that at least sketched out in 84. Will be difficult to deploy at scale w/out reporting but we hope there will be some sites that can provide feedback.

mkwst: Dan, do you know Mozilla's plans?

dveditz: sorry no, was hoping Anne or Freddy would be here and Freddy is lost on the call fork.

mkwst: https://resourcepolicy.fyi/  I've started with CDNs (like bootstrap CDN or jquery). They typically only supply public data so they should be the easy case to just mark everything embeddable. Other sites will have to make more complex decisions about individual resources or embeddors. But sites that supply widgets or other public resources should be able to do this easily. Please help out by looking at that site and reaching out to sites.

dveditz: Still have bugs, no clear estimates, hoping for first half of the year. 

artur: Blah! Structured Headers -- should COOP & COEP be structured headers?

mkwst: COEP is a structured header, COOP seems reasonably defined as one too. IETF is telling us that Structured Headers are where we should go, so I'm happy to go along.

artur: [thumbs up emoji]

### Trusted Types

mkwst: Similar update to last time, similar timelines to COOP/COEP. Were planning on shipping in 82, now it will be in 83. I believe we got all the stuff we wanted into the 83 branch, would appreciate people playing with Beta and giving us feedback. Let us know if you can or cannot deploy Truste Types. Want to know whether what we've built is actually usable.

dveditz: will it require a flag?

mkwst: on by default in 83


### Securer Contexts

mkwst: we talked about the general idea of this last time. Up to know we've talked about "secure context" as "delivered over secure transit". Time to look into other kinds of security we might ask of a site. For example the kinds of isolation provided by COOP/COEP might be a prerequisite for some advanced features. Another kind of security is secure against injection attacks. Two mechanisms we have for that are CSP and maybe in the future Trusted Types. The isolation mechanisms seem relatively well defined, we could put guidelines together. CSP is less clear. Artur and others have tried to describe what a "strict" version of CSP would look like.

...: I'm particularly interested in whether others here, particularly Mozilla, are interested in pursuing the next iteration of this. We haven't yet gotten "Secure Context" to PR yet, but is there interest in this next iteration.

dveditz: I don't know what people will ultimately agree upon, but we're interested in the isolation mechanisms. We are looking at what things should be gated on requiring some of that. Obviously, should try to have interop between browsers. Spec might be a good idea.

mkwst: a good thing to document would be a shared threat model. What we have today and what we'll have tomorrow (isolation primitives) and what things should be locked behind those requirements. _everything_ ought to be locked behind secure transport, but not clear everything needs to require isolation. 

### Fetch Metadata

artur: *sigh* Yes, Fetch Metadata is being rolled out across Google fairly quickly. [the end]

dveditz: Mozilla has implemented, is testing. Believe it's in beta now.

artur: [thumbs up emoji]

mkwst: Artur. Is your team thinking about publishing anything around the policies we're deploying at Google?

artur: Yes, we're planning to publish the policies we're using at https://secmetadata.appspot.com -- after fixing them up a bit to make the logic better.


### Cookies

https://mikewest.github.io/cookie-incrementalism/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism.html

mkwst: the incrementalism draft has grown a few things, for example binding the scheme to the cookie.

Schemeful Same-Site: https://mikewest.github.io/cookie-incrementalism/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism.html#rfc.section.3.3

https://mikewest.github.io/cookie-incrementalism/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism.html#rfc.section.3.4
https://mikewest.github.io/cookie-incrementalism/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism.html#rfc.section.3.5
https://mikewest.github.io/cookie-incrementalism/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism.html#rfc.section.3.6

mkwst: those sections aim to teach cookies about schemes and segregate cookies created over HTTP from cookies created over HTTPS

Conversation in the TAG review: https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/483

mkwst: Mozilla has also expressed interest in this in their standards-position repo

https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/298

mkwst: I don't expect this work to happen in this WG, will probably migrate back to the IETF for standards work. But I'm sure it's of interest to the people in this group.

dveditz: Yay.


### Mixed Content

carlosil: Mixed Content image autoupgrades were meant to launch on 81, now delayed until at least M84. Same with mixed downloads. Mixed audio and video autoupgrades, which launched on 80 will remain enabled.

...: Mixed forms. Thinking about adding a warning in Chrome about mixed form submissions `onsubmit`, for the most part this is an implementation detail that won't result in spec changes. However, there's an open (spec) issue about redirects to HTTP not being considered mixed content. Since the new Chrome warning will address redirects, I'll add wording to MIX2 about optionally showing a warning if a form submission is redirected through HTTP.

mkwst: Also a MIX2 draft?

carlosil: Yes. Aims to completely replace MIX1 with MIX2. [Pull Request](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-mixed-content/pull/30)

### These Calls

dveditz: WebEx is amazing and wonderful, but perhaps something else could be more amazing and more wonderful? W3C seems to be hosting Zoom calls. Also WebRTC things, Hangouts, etc. Maybe we don't want to require video, given bandwidth, etc...

...: Mozilla uses Zoom, can dial in with a phone number. Can do the same with Hangouts Meet.

wseltzer: We could do that. Apologies if my absence from the beginning of the call contributed to the call weirdness. 

sam: There's the risk of Zoombombing unless we sit on credentials in the same way. Ok with that?

mkwst: Sure. That's what we're doing today. Let's try that out for the next call.
