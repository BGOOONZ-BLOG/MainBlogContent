[Version sent to the Director, 2015-07-08]


Philippe, Ralph,

The CSVW Working Group requests transition to CR status for four specifications on CSV on the Web. The publication is planned for the 16th of July; the documents are follows:

a. Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web
b. Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data
c. Generating RDF from Web Tabular Data
d. Generating JSON from Web Tabular Data


(1) Document title, URIs, Abstract and Status
=============================================

a. Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web
-------------------------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-syntax/Overview.html
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-tabular-data-model-20150716/

Abstract:

Tabular data is routinely transferred on the web in a variety of formats, including variants on CSV, tab-delimited files, fixed field formats, spreadsheets, HTML tables, and SQL dumps. This document outlines a data model, or infoset, for tabular data and metadata about that tabular data that can be used as a basis for validation, display, or creating other formats. It also contains some non-normative guidance for publishing tabular data as CSV and how that maps into the tabular data model.

An annotated model of tabular data can be supplemented by separate metadata about the table. This specification defines how implementations should locate that metadata, given a file containing tabular data. The standard syntax for that metadata is defined in [tabular-metadata]. Note, however, that applications may have other means to create annotated tables, e.g., through some application specific API-s; this model does not depend on the specificities described in [tabular-metadata].

Status:
	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-syntax/#h-sotd

b. Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data
---------------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-metadata/Overview.html
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-tabular-metadata-20150716/

Abstract:

Validation, conversion, display, and search of tabular data on the web requires additional metadata that describes how the data should be interpreted. This document defines a vocabulary for metadata that annotates tabular data. This can be used to provide metadata at various levels, from groups of tables and how they relate to each other down to individual cells within a table.

The metadata defined in this specification is used to provide annotations on an annotated table or group of tables, as defined in [tabular-data-model]. Annotated tables form the basis for all further processing, such as validating, converting, or displaying the tables.

Status:
	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-metadata/#h-sotd

c. Generating RDF from Web Tabular Data
---------------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-csv2rdf/Overview.html
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-csv2rdf-20150716/

Abstract:

This document defines the procedures and rules to be applied when converting tabular data into RDF. Tabular data may be complemented with metadata annotations that describe its structure, the meaning of its content and how it may form part of a collection of interrelated tabular data. This document specifies the effect of this metadata on the resulting RDF.

Status:
	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-csv2rdf/#h-sotd

d. Generating JSON from Web Tabular Data
----------------------------------------

- Version ready to be published
	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-csv2json/Overview.html
- Final /TR URI when it gets published
	http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/CR-csv2json-20150716/

Abstract:

This document defines the procedures and rules to be applied when converting tabular data into JSON. Tabular data may be complemented with metadata annotations that describe its structure, the meaning of its content and how it may form part of a collection of interrelated tabular data. This document specifies the effect of this metadata on the resulting JSON.

(2)  Record of the decision to request the transition
=====================================================

	http://www.w3.org/2015/07/08-csvw-minutes.html#transition

(3) Record of Changes
=====================

The separate section of each document records the noteworthy changes.

(4) Evidence that the document satisfies group's requirements
===============================================================

The requirements satisfied by the document are listed in the use cases and requirements document:

	http://www.w3.org/TR/csvw-ucr/
Editors' draft:
	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/use-cases-and-requirements/

The group intends to publish a final version of the UCR document as a WG Note at the time of publishing the PR; the remaining work is to document how the various requirements are reflected in the final documents.

(4.1) CSV to XML conversion
---------------------------

The charter of the Working Group:
	http://www.w3.org/2013/05/lcsv-charter.html

also included a work item for a csv to XML conversion. The Working Group has repeatedly tried to find XML experts who would have accepted to this work. Nobody volunteered to join the group for this work and, furthermore, the Use case document did not contain any pressing requests to have an XML conversion available. There was a more extensive discussion at the F2F meeting at TPAC:
	http://www.w3.org/2014/10/27-csvw-minutes.html

followed by attempts to talk to people in the XML community. This did not lead to any results. As a consequence, on its F2F meeting in February 2015 the group has resolved to abandon this:
	http://www.w3.org/2015/02/12-csvw-minutes.html#charter

(4.2) Relationship to R2RML
---------------------------

The charter of the Working Group
	http://www.w3.org/2013/05/lcsv-charter.html

required that "The output of the mapping mechanism for RDF MUST be consistent with either the RDF Direct Mapping or R2RML so that if a table from a relational database is exported as CSV and then mapped it produces semantically identical data."

The evolution of the CSVW metadata and mapping, and the differences between the formats and the usages of CSV-s and a Relational Databases did not make it possible to provide a 100% round-trip in all circumstances (although it works in most of the cases). A separate (non-normative) Appendix has been added to the csv2rdf document describing the relationships:

	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-csv2rdf/#relationship-to-rdb-direct-mapping

Note that this Appendix is also an answer to one of the LCCR issues:

	https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues/506

(5) Evidence that the document has received wide review and that issues have  been formally addressed
=====================================================================================================

The group has received and recoreded a number of issues; additionaly, when the Group issued a Working Draft on the 16 April 2015, it also explicitly asked for a wide review (declaring the April version as some sort of a virtual LC). All the comments coming up to this transition have been addressed and resolved satisfactorily:

All issues (removing admin issues):
	https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+-label%3A%22WG+Admin%22

All open issues currently:
	- https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues

All open issues, minus on those on the use case document (non rec-track), on the test suite, or administrative issues:

	https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3A%22Use+Case+Document%22+-label%3A%22WG+Admin%22+-label%3A%22Test+Suite%22+
	(http://j.mp/1HfPzdZ)

(Some issues have been postponed to a next version.)

The WG explicitly asked review from Internationalization, Accessibility, Privacy and Security, IANA (on the future registration of csvm), and the TAG (on a specific issue, see below). It has received, and handled comments from:

	I18n: https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22LC+official+review%3A+I18N%22+
	A11y: https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22LC+official+review%3A+A11y%22+
	IANA: https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22LC+official+review%3A+IANA%22+
	TAG:  https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues/555 (see also below)

Decisions on the issues, answers to, and responses from commenter are all registered in the issue thread.

(6) Objections
==============

There were no formal objections.

(7) Features marked as "at risk"
================================

There is one. Its history is documented at:

	https://github.com/w3c/csvw/issues/555

and is documented as 'at risk' in the document:

	http://w3c.github.io/csvw/publishing-snapshots/CR-syntax/index.html#h-issue1

A short summary: the question is around how to locate a metadata file if only the URL of the CSV file are known. While the preferred approach is using the HTTP response header, it is recognized that, for some data publishers, that is not really an option they can use. As a fallback position the April 2015 draft proposed two more *fixed* URI-s, whose exact form was derived from the URI of the CSV file.

The WG asked the TAG for an opinion; after some discussion the TAG decided to advice the usage of .well-known for that purpose. The WG has accepted this, and this solution is now part of the document. However, David Booth started a discussion around this lately, disputing the TAG's decision:

	https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2015Jun/0011.html

but there has been no real consensus on the issue between him and the TAG. To move forward, the WG has decided to flag this solution as an at-risk feature for now.


(8) Patent disclosures
======================

No patent disclosures for these documents at the moment

	https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/68238/exclude

(9)  Implementation information
===============================

The working group intends to  issue a call for implementations and demonstrate at least two
interoperable implementations before requesting advancement to PR.

A document with test cases, how to test, etc. is at:

	http://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/tests/

At the moment there are over 600 tests available. A preliminary implementation report is also available at

	http://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/tests/reports/

(At the moment, this URI is redirected to GitHub; we may decide to copy the content and fix it at the time of publication of the Recommendation to have a stable version.)

At the moment, we have information on six different implementations; one of those (in Ruby) is fairly complete right now. The goal is to have at least two, mutually independent implementation for each test case in the official test suite.

We suggest that the CR period last until October 30.  There should be several implementations of both specs by then.
