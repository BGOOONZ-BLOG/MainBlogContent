			<h1>Features</h1>

			<p>This section covers the major features of EPUB, including important components and topics that apply to
				the process of authoring <a>EPUB Publications</a> as a whole.</p>

			<section id="sec-package-file">
				<h2>Package Document</h2>

				<p>Every EPUB Publication contains at least one <a>Rendition</a> of its contents, each of which is
					represented by a <a>Package Document</a>.</p>

				<p>The Package Document specifies all the resources required to render that representation of the
					content. The Package Document also defines a reading order for linear consumption, and associates
					metadata and navigation information for the Rendition.</p>

				<p>The Package Document represents a significant improvement on a typical Web site. A Web site, for
					example, embeds references to its resources within its content, which, while a simple and flexible
					means of identifying resources, makes it difficult to enumerate all the resources required to render
					it. In addition, there is no standard way for a Web site to define that a sequence of pages make up
					a larger publication, which is precisely what EPUB's <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-spine-elem"
							><code>spine</code> element</a> [[Packages32]] does (i.e., it provides an external
					declarative means to explicitly specify navigation through a collection of documents). Finally, the
					Package Document defines a standard way to represent metadata globally applicable to a collection of
					pages.</p>

				<p>The Package Document also includes a <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-collection-elem"
							><code>collection</code> element</a> [[Packages32]], which allows grouping of
					logically-related <a>Publication Resources</a>. This element exists to enable the development of
					specialized content identification, processing and rendering features, such as the ability to define
					embedded preview content, or assemble an index or dictionary from its constituent XHTML Content
					Documents.</p>

				<p>The Package Document and other Rendition-specific constructs are specified in [[Packages32]].</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-nav">
				<h2>Navigation</h2>

				<section id="sec-nav-order">
					<h3>Reading Order</h3>

					<p>A key concept of EPUB is that an EPUB Publication consists of multiple resources that can be
						completely navigated and consumed by a person or program <em>in some specific order</em>.</p>

					<p>Many types of publication have an obvious reading order, or logical progression through their
						content. A novel is an example of a highly sequential document — it typically has a beginning,
						middle and end — but not all publications are so ordered: a cookbook or collection of
						photographic images might be considered to be more like a database. All documents do, however,
						have at least one logical ordering of all their top-level content items, whether by date, topic,
						location or some other criteria (e.g., a cookbook is typically ordered by type of recipe).</p>

					<p>Each Rendition of an EPUB Publication defines at least one such logical ordering of all its
						top-level content (the <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-spine-elem">spine</a> [[Packages32]]), as
						well as a declarative table of contents (the <a>EPUB Navigation Document</a> [[EPUB32]]). EPUB
						Publications make these data structures available in a machine-readable way <em>external</em> to
						the content, simplifying their discovery and use.</p>

					<p>EPUB Publications are not limited to the linear ordering of their contents, nor do they preclude
						linking in arbitrary ways — just like the Web, EPUB Publications are built on hypertext — but
						the basic consumption and navigation can be reliably accomplished in a way that is not true for
						a set of HTML pages.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="sec-nav-nav-doc">
					<h3>Navigation Document</h3>

					<p>Each Rendition of an EPUB Publication contains a special XHTML Content Document called the
							<a>EPUB Navigation Document</a>, which uses the [[HTML]] <code>nav</code> element to define
						human- and machine-readable navigation information.</p>

					<p>The Navigation Document replaces the EPUB 2 NCX document [[OPS2]]. The Navigation Document, while
						maintaining the baseline accessibility and navigation support and features of the NCX,
						introduces new functionality and rendering features to enhance navigation for all users. Prime
						among these are better support for internationalization (as an XHTML document itself, the
						Navigation Document natively supports ruby annotations) and support for embedded grammars
						(MathML and SVG can be included within navigation links).</p>

					<p>As XHTML Content Documents, Navigation Documents also provide a flexible means of tailoring the
						navigation display using CSS and the <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-package-nav-def-hidden"
								><code>hidden</code> attribute</a> [[Packages32]] while not impacting access to
						information for accessible Reading Systems.</p>

					<p>The structure and semantics of Navigation Documents are defined in <a
							href="epub-packages.html#sec-package-nav">EPUB Navigation Document</a> [[Packages32]].</p>

				</section>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-metadata">
				<h2>Metadata</h2>

				<p>EPUB Publications provide a rich array of options for adding metadata. Each Rendition's Package
					Document includes a dedicated <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-metadata-elem"><code>metadata</code>
						section</a> [[Packages32]] for general information about the EPUB Publication, allowing titles,
					authors, identifiers and other information about the EPUB Publication to be easily accessed. It also
					provides the means to attach complete bibliographic records using the <a
						href="epub-packages.html#sec-link-elem"><code>link</code> element</a> [[Packages32]].</p>

				<p>The Package Document also allows a <a>Unique Identifier</a> to be established for the EPUB
					Publication using the <a href="epub-packages.html#attrdef-package-unique-identifier"
							><code>unique-identifier</code> attribute</a> [[Packages32]]. The required last-modified
					date in the Package metadata section can be joined with this identifier to define a <a>Release
						Identifier</a>, which provides a means of distinguishing different versions of an EPUB
					Publication (see <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-package-metadata-identifiers">Publication
						Identifiers</a> [[Packages32]]). The Package Identifier addresses the issue of how to release an
					EPUB Publication without changing its Unique Identifier while still identifying it as a new
					version.</p>

				<p>XHTML Content Documents also include the means of annotating document markup with rich metadata,
					making them more semantically meaningful and useful both for processing and accessibility purposes
						(<a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection">XHTML Semantic Inflection</a>
					[[ContentDocs32]]). Both RDFa and Microdata attributes can also be used in XHTML Content Documents,
					enabling content-level metadata expressions (<a
						href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-semantic-enrichment">XHTML Semantic Enrichment</a>
					[[ContentDocs32]]).</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-content-docs">
				<h2>Content Documents</h2>

				<p>Each Rendition of an EPUB Publication contains one or more <a>EPUB Content Documents</a>, as defined
					in [[EPUB32]]. These are XHTML or SVG documents that describe the readable content and reference
					associated media resources (e.g., images, audio and video clips).</p>

				<p><a>XHTML Content Documents</a> are defined by a profile of [[HTML]].</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-fxl">
				<h2>Fixed Layouts</h2>

				<p>Although EPUB's history is steeped in enabling reflowable content, not all publications lend
					themselves easily to reflowing. Children's books, comics and manga, magazines and many other content
					forms require the ability to create page-precise layouts in order to be represented
					meaningfully.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 includes metadata that allows the creation of <a
						href="epub-packages.html#sec-package-metadata-fxl">fixed-layout XHTML Content Documents</a>
					[[Packages32]], in addition to existing capabilities for fixed layouts in SVG. This metadata enables
					the <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-fxl-html-svg-dimensions">dimensions of the page</a>
					[[ContentDocs32]] to be controlled, creating a canvas on which elements can be absolutely
					positioned.</p>

				<p>The metadata does not just flag whether content is to be fixed or reflowed, but also allows Authors
					to specify the desired <a href="epub-packages.html#orientation">orientation of pages</a>
					[[Packages32]], when to <a href="epub-packages.html#spread">create synthetic spreads</a>
					[[Packages32]], and <a href="epub-packages.html#page-spread">how to position pages</a>
					[[Packages32]] within those spreads, providing a broad range of control over the presentation of
					EPUB Publications.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-rendering">
				<h2>Rendering and CSS</h2>

				<p>A key concept of EPUB is that content presentation adapts to the user, rather than the user having to
					adapt to a particular presentation of content. HTML was originally designed to support dynamic
					rendering of structured content, but over time HTML as supported in Web browsers has become focused
					on the needs of Web applications, and most popular Web sites now have fixed-format layouts.</p>

				<p>EPUB Publications, however, are designed to maximize accessibility for the visually impaired, and
					Reading Systems typically perform text line layout and pagination on the fly, adapting to the size
					of the display area, the user's preferred font size, and other environmental factors. This behavior
					is not guaranteed in EPUB; images, vector graphics, video and other non-reflowable content might be
					included, and some Reading Systems might not paginate on the fly, or at all. Nevertheless,
					supporting dynamic adaptive layout and accessibility has been a primary design consideration
					throughout the evolution of the EPUB standard.</p>

				<p>EPUB Content Documents can reference CSS Style Sheets, allowing Authors to define the desired
					rendering properties. EPUB 3 follows support for CSS as defined in the [[CSSSnapshot]].</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also supports CSS styles that enable both horizontal and vertical layout and bo left-to-right
					and right-to-left writing. Refer to <a href="#sec-gls-css">CSS</a> in the Global Language Support
					section for more information.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-multimedia">
				<h2>Multimedia</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports audio and video embedded in <a>XHTML Content Documents</a> via the [[HTML]]
						<code>audio</code> and <code>video</code> elements, inheriting all the functionality and
					features these elements provide. For more information on audio and video formats, refer to
					[[EPUB32]].</p>

				<p>Another key multimedia feature in EPUB 3 is the inclusion of <a>Media Overlay Documents</a>
					[[MediaOverlays32]]. When pre-recorded narration is available for a Rendition of an EPUB
					Publication, Media Overlays provide the ability to synchronize that audio with the text of a Content
					Document (see also <a href="#sec-access-overlays">Aural Renditions and Media Overlays</a>).</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-fonts">
				<h2>Fonts</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports two closely-related font formats — OpenType [[OpenType]] and WOFF [[WOFF]] [[WOFF2]]
					— to accommodate both traditional publishing workflows and emerging Web-based workflows. Word
					processing programs used to create EPUB Publications are likely to have access only to a collection
					of installed OpenType fonts, for example, whereas Web-archival EPUB generators will likely only have
					access to WOFF resources (which cannot be converted to OpenType without undesirable, and potentially
					unlicensed, stripping of WOFF metadata).</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 also supports both obfuscated and regular font resources for both OpenType and WOFF font
					formats. Support for obfuscated font resources is required to accommodate font licensing
					restrictions for many commercially-available fonts.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-scripting">
				<h2>Scripting</h2>

				<p>EPUB strives to treat content <em>declaratively</em> — as data that can be manipulated, not programs
					to be executed — but does support scripting as defined in [[HTML]] and [[SVG2]] (refer to <a
						href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-scripted-content">Scripting</a> [[ContentDocs32]] for more
					information).</p>

				<p>It is important to note, however, that EPUB 3 does not require scripting support in Reading Systems,
					and scripting might be disabled for security reasons.</p>

				<p>Authors need to be aware that scripting in an EPUB Publication can create security considerations
					that are different from scripting within a Web browser. For example, typical same-origin policies
					are not applicable to content that has been downloaded to a user's local system. Therefore, it is
					strongly encouraged that scripting be limited to container constrained contexts, as further
					described in <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-scripted-content-content-reqs">Scripted Content
						Documents — Content Conformance</a> [[ContentDocs32]].</p>

				<p>In other words, consider limiting scripting to cases where it is essential to the user experience,
					since it greatly increases the likelihood that content will not be portable across all Reading
					Systems and creates barriers to accessibility and content reusability.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-tts">
				<h2>Text-to-speech</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 provides the following text-to-speech (TTS) facilities for controlling aspects of speech
					synthesis, such as pronunciation, prosody and voice characteristics:</p>

				<dl class="labels">
					<dt>Pronunciation Lexicons</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The inclusion of generic pronunciation lexicons using the W3C PLS format
							[[PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]] enables Authors to provide pronunciation rules that apply to the
							entire EPUB Publication. Refer to <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-pls">Pronunciation
								Lexicons</a> [[ContentDocs32]] for more information.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Inline SSML Phonemes</dt>
					<dd>
						<p> The incorporation of SSML phonemes functionality [[SSML]] directly into a <a>EPUB Content
								Document</a> enables fine-grained pronunciation control, taking precedence over default
							pronunciation rules and/or referenced pronunciation lexicons (as provided by the PLS format
							mentioned above). Refer to <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-ssml-attrib">SSML
								Attributes</a> [[ContentDocs32]] for more information.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-container">
				<h2>Container</h2>

				<p>An EPUB Publication is transported and interchanged as a single file (a "portable document") that
					contains the Package Documents, all Content Documents and all other required resources for
					processing the included Renditions. The single-file container format for EPUB is based on the widely
					adopted ZIP format, and an XML document that identifies the location of the Package Document for
					each Rendition in the ZIP archive is located at a pre-defined location within the archive.</p>

				<p>This approach provides a clear contract between any creator of an EPUB Publication and any system
					which consumes such EPUB Publications, as well as a reliable representation that is independent of
					network transport or file system specifics.</p>

				<p>An EPUB Publication's representation as a container file is specified in [[OCF32]].</p>

			</section>

		</section>
		<section id="sec-gls">
			<h1>Global Language Support</h1>

			<section id="sec-gls-metadata">
				<h2>Metadata</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 supports alternate representations of all text metadata items in the package metadata section
					to improve global distribution of EPUB Publications. The <a
						href="epub-packages.html#alternate-script"><code>alternate-script</code> property</a>
					[[Packages32]] can be combined with the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute to include and identify
					alternate script renderings of language-specific metadata.</p>

				<p>Using this property, a Japanese EPUB Publication could, for example, include an alternate
					Roman-script representation of the author's name and/or an one or more representations of the title
					in a Romance language.</p>

				<p>The <code>page-progression-direction</code> attribute also allows the content flow direction to be
					globally specified for all Content Documents to facilitate rendering (see the <a
						href="epub-packages.html#attrdef-spine-page-progression-direction"
						>page-progression-direction</a> [[Packages32]]).</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-gls-content-docs">
				<h2>Content Documents</h2>

				<p>XHTML Content Documents leverage the HTML directionality features to improve support for
					bidirectional content rendering: the <code>bdi</code> element allows an instance of directional text
					to be isolated from the surrounding content, the <code>bdo</code> element allows directionality to
					be overridden for its child content and the <code>dir</code> attribute allows the directionality of
					any element to be explicitly set.</p>

				<p>XHTML Content Documents also support ruby annotations for pronunciation support (which makes them
					supported in Navigation Document links, as well).</p>

				<p>SVG Content Documents support the rendering of bidirectional text, but do not include support for
					ruby.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-gls-css">
				<h2>CSS</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3's support for CSS3 modules enables typography for many different languages and cultures. Some
					specific enhancements include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>support for vertical writing, which also provides Reading Systems the ability to allow users
							to toggle direction;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>better handling of emphasis, such as the inclusion of bōten;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>better control over line breaking, so that breaks can occur at the character level for
							languages that do not use spaces to delimit new words; and</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>better control over hyphenation, to further facilitate line breaking.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-gls-fonts">
				<h2>Fonts</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 does not require that Reading Systems come with any particular set of built-in system fonts.
					As occurs in Web contexts, users in a particular locale might have installed fonts that omit
					characters required for other locales, and Reading Systems might utilize intrinsic fonts or font
					engines that do not utilize operating system installed fonts. As a result, the text content of an
					EPUB Publication might not natively render as intended on all Reading Systems.</p>

				<p>To address this problem, EPUB 3 supports the embedding of fonts to facilitate the rendering of text
					content, and this practice is advised in order to ensure content is rendered as intended.</p>

				<p>Support for embedded fonts also ensures that characters and glyphs unique to an EPUB Publication can
					be embedded for proper display.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-gls-tts">
				<h2>Text-to-speech</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3's support for PLS documents and SSML attributes increases the pronunciation control that
					Authors have over the rendering of any natural language in text-to-speech-enabled Reading Systems.
					Refer to <a href="#sec-tts">Text-to-speech</a> in the Features section for more information on these
					capabilities.</p>

				<p>The combination of CSS Speech and inline SSML phonemes also allows fine control over ruby.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-gls-container">
				<h2>Container</h2>

				<p>The OCF container format supports UTF-8, allowing for internationalized file and directory naming of
					content resources.</p>

			</section>

		</section>
		<section id="sec-accessibility">
			<h1>Accessibility</h1>

			<p>A major goal of EPUB is to facilitate content accessibility, and a variety of features in EPUB 3 support
				this requirement. This section reviews these features, detailing some established best practices for
				ensuring that EPUB Publications are accessible where applicable.</p>

			<p>EPUB 3 also includes an Accessibility specification [[EPUBAccessibility]] that leverages the extensive
				work done to make Web content accessible in [[WCAG20]]. The specification defines requirements for the
				production of EPUB Publications that can be accessed by a wide range of users. It is accompanied by a
				techniques document that outlines best practices for meeting the requirements.</p>

			<p>It is important to note that while accessibility is important in its own right, accessible content is
				also more valuable content: an accessible EPUB Publication will be adaptable to more devices and be
				easier to reuse, in whole or in part, via human and automated workflows. The EPUB Working Group strongly
				recommends that Authors ensure that they generate accessible content.</p>

			<section id="sec-access-nav">
				<h2>Navigation</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 improves on NCX documents with the addition of <a>EPUB Navigation Documents</a>. As noted in
						<a href="#sec-nav-nav-doc">Navigation Document</a> above, the navigation features represent a
					more universal and flexible navigation system.</p>

				<p>The Navigation Document can also be reused in the body of an EPUB Publication by including it in the
						<code>spine</code>. To avoid the situation in highly structured documents where it might not be
					desirable to display the complete table of contents to users in the body, the display level can be
					modified using the [[HTML]] <code>hidden</code> attribute. This attribute is ignored by Reading
					Systems when they render the table of contents outside the <code>spine</code> (e.g., in their own
					specialized views), which avoids minimizing the information that is available.</p>

				<p>Authors are also encouraged to supply additional <code>nav</code> elements if their EPUB Publications
					contain non-structural points of interest, such as figures, tables, etc. in order to further enhance
					access to the content.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-access-semantic-markup">
				<h2>Semantic Markup</h2>

				<p>[[HTML]] supports a number of elements that make markup more semantically meaningful (e.g.,
						<code>section</code>, <code>nav</code> and <code>aside</code>) and introduces more clearly
					defined semantics for some HTML4 elements. Make use of these elements, in conjunction with best
					practices for authoring well-structured Web content, when creating EPUB XHTML Content Documents.
					These additions allow content to be better grouped and defined, both for representing the structure
					of documents and to facilitate their logical navigation. XHTML Content Documents also natively
					support the inclusion of ARIA role and state attributes and events, enhancing the ability of
					Assistive Technologies to interact with the content.</p>

				<p>EPUB 3 includes the <code>epub:type</code> attribute, which is meant to be functionally equivalent to
					the W3C Role Attribute [[Role-Attribute]]. This attribute allows any element in an XHTML Content
					Document to include additional information about its purpose and meaning within the work, using
					controlled vocabularies and terms. Refer to <a
						href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection">XHTML Semantic Inflection</a>
					[[ContentDocs32]] for more information.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-access-layout">
				<h2>Dynamic Layouts</h2>

				<p>The design center of EPUB is dynamic layout: content is typically intended to be formatted on the fly
					rather than being typeset in a paginated manner in advance (i.e., expecting a particular sized
					"page"). This core capability is useful, for example, for optimizing rendering onto different sized
					device screens or window sizes, and it facilitates and simplifies content accessibility.</p>

				<p>While it is possible to incorporate more highly formatted content in EPUB — for example via bitmap
					images or SVG graphics, or even use of CSS explicit positioning and/or table elements to achieve
					particular visual layouts — Authors are strongly discouraged from utilizing such techniques. They
					are not reliable in EPUB since many Reading Systems render content in a paginated manner rather than
					creating a single scrolling <a>Viewport</a> and since each Reading System might define its own
					pagination algorithm. If these techniques are necessary to convey the content of the publication,
					consider including <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-foreign-restrictions">fallbacks</a> [[EPUB32]] (e.g.,

				<p>In general, it is preferable to achieve visual richness by using CSS Style Sheets without absolute

				<h2>Aural Renditions and Media Overlays</h2>

				<p>Aural renderings of content are important for accessibility and are a desirable feature for many
					other users. A baseline to facilitate aural rendering is to utilize semantic HTML designed for
					dynamic layout. Refer to <a href="#sec-tts">Text-to-speech</a> for more information on how to use
					the native facilities that EPUB XHTML Documents include.</p>

				<p>[[MediaOverlays32]] provides the ability to synchronize the text and audio content of an EPUB
					Publication, a feature already familiar to readers of DAISY Digital Talking Books. Overlays
					transcend the accessibility domain in their usefulness: the synchronization of text and audio as a
					tool for learning to read, for example, being of benefit in many circumstances.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-access-fallbacks">
				<h2>Fallbacks</h2>

				<p>Not all formats are accessible in their native format, and not all users prefer to read in the
					default format provided. EPUB defines a variety of means for providing fallbacks so that alternate
					renderings can be made available in these cases.</p>

				<p>Publication- and content-level fallbacks are defined in <a
						href="epub-spec.html#sec-foreign-restrictions">Foreign Resources</a> [[EPUB32]]. These fallback
					mechanisms enable the inclusion of Foreign Resources in an EPUB Publication and ensure compatibility
					of EPUB 3 content across Reading Systems with varying capabilities (e.g., they allow the inclusion
					of multiple video formats, and the inclusion of XHTML fallbacks to SVG Content Documents for EPUB 2
					Reading Systems).</p>

				<p>In addition, multiple instances of a complete work can be delivered in a single EPUB Publication by
					defining multiple <code>rootfile</code> elements in the OCF container file (as described in <a
						href="epub-ocf.html#sec-container-metainf-container.xml">Container File
							(<code>container.xml</code>)</a> [[OCF32]]). These alternate Rendition fallbacks might be
					used, for example, so that a formatted graphic novel defined via a sequence of SVG pages can be
					accompanied by an accessible text version defined via XHTML.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="sec-access-scripting">
				<h2>Scripting</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3 adopts a progressive enhancement approach for scripted content, whereby scripting has to not
					interfere with the integrity of the document (i.e., not result in information loss when scripting is
					not available). Consequently, although documents that do employ scripting <a
						href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-scripted-content">can provide fallbacks</a> [[ContentDocs32]] to
					further facilitate access to their contents, the documents have to be accessible without them.</p>

				<p>Ensure that you always implement best practices for accessible scripting in Web documents, such as
					provided in [[WAI-ARIA]], and reserve the use of scripting for situations in which interactivity is
					critical to the user experience.</p>

			<h2>EPUB Revision History</h2>

			<section id="epub2">
				<h3>OEB, OCF and EPUB 2: 1999—2010</h3>

				<p>EPUB has its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication Structure (OEBPS).
					OEBPS 1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an organization that later became the
					International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the
					IDPF in 2001 and 2002 respectively.</p>

				<p>It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for delivery as well as
					interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container format for OEPBS, which was
					approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS
					began in parallel which was approved as the renamed EPUB 2.0 in October, 2007, consisting of a
					triumvirate of specifications: Open Package Format (OPF), Open Publication Format (OPF) together
					with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a maintenance update to the 2.0 specification set primarily intended clarify
					and correct errata in the specifications, was approved in September, 2010. [[OPF2]] [[OPS2]]

				<h3>EPUB 3.0: 2010</h3>

				<p>Work on a major revision of the EPUB specifications began in 2010, with the goal of aligning EPUB
					more closely with HTML, and in the process bringing new, native multimedia features, sophisticated
					CSS layout rendering and font embedding, scripted interactivity, enhanced global language support,
					and improved accessibility. A new specification, EPUB Media Overlays was also introduced, enabling
					text and audio synchronization in EPUB Publications. To better align the specification names with
					the standard, the Open Package Format specification was renamed EPUB Publications and the Open
					Publication Format specification was renamed EPUB Content Documents. The EPUB 3.0 specifications
					were approved in October, 2011. [[Publications30]] [[ContentDocs30]] [[OCF30]] [[MediaOverlays30]]

				<h3>EPUB 3.0.1: 2014</h3>
				<p>The EPUB 3.0.1 revision was undertaken in 2013-14. Although introducing mostly minor fixes and
					updates, it did see the integration of Fixed Layout Documents, which give Authors greater control
					over presentation when a reflowable EPUB is not suitable for the content. [[Publications301]]

				<h3>EPUB 3.1: 2017</h3>
				<p>EPUB 3.1 was the first minor revision of EPUB 3. The goal of this revision was to better align EPUB 3
					with current Web standards. References to important standards were made undated, meaning that
					whenever they are updated they are legal to use in EPUB 3 content (e.g., the latest version of HTML
					is always valid to use; a revision of EPUB is not needed). The use of CSS was also clarified, and
					the use of EPUB-specific properties reduced.</p>
				<p>Many EPUB-specific features were also removed from the standard, in particular content switching,
					triggers, and bindings. This change necessitated a new Package Document version number.[[EPUB31]]

				<h3>EPUB 3.2: 2018</h3>
				<p>EPUB 3.2 was undertaken shortly after EPUB 3.1 in order to restore compatibility of content to EPUB
					3. The change of version number introduced in EPUB 3.1 meant that authors, vendors and reading
					system developers would have to produce, distribute and consume two versions of EPUB content, but
					the costs of this change outweighed the benefits of the new version. EPUB 3.2 instead keeps all the
					best parts of EPUB 3.1, but returns and deprecates the removed elements so that a new version number
					is not necessary in the Package Document. [[EPUB32]] [[Packages32]] [[ContentDocs32]] [[OCF32]]
