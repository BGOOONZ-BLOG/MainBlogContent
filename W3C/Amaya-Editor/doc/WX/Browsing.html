<h2 id="Browsing">Browsing</h2>

<p>Amaya is mainly an editor with browsing capabilities. It allows you to edit
and browse Web documents simultaneously. Browsing with Amaya is similar to
browsing with other Web browsers except for <a href="#Activating1">activating a
link</a> and <a href="#Using">using forms</a>.</p>

<p>Amaya allows you to display and edit HTML documents, as well as some XML
document types: XHTML, MathML (mathematical expressions), and SVG (graphics).
It also allows you to access other XML document types and to display their
content according to their CSS style sheets. For these XML documents some
editing functions are available.</p>

<h3 id="Activating1">Activating a link</h3>

<p>Because Amaya is both a browser and an editor, you get different results
when you single-click, double-click, or right-click a link.</p>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>Single-click</kbd> a link to move the cursor to that position in the
    document. The status bar displays the expanded URI of the link. You can now
    edit the content of the link.</li>
  <li><kbd>Double-click</kbd> a link to activate it and skip to its target. The
    document retrieved by this operation replaces the current document in the
    same tab as the original document. If the original document was modified
    and has not been saved yet, a dialog box is displayed. It allows you to
    save the changes you have made before replacing the original document. 
    <p class="Note">If you have chosen a <a
    href="Configure.html#Profile">profile</a> without the navigation feature,
    or if you are in help pages, the retrieved document is displayed in a new
    tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li><kbd>Right-click</kbd> a link (or <kbd>Cmd + Single-click</kbd> on MacOS
    X) to activate the link and open the target document in a new tab or a new
    window (a pop-up menu allows you to choose).</li>
</ul>

<p class="Note">This behavior can be changed through the <strong><a
href="Configure.html#Browsing">Browsing</a></strong> tab under the
<strong>Preferences</strong> dialog. By changing option <strong>Double click
activates link</strong>, you can browse documents with a single click as you
would in a traditional Web browser. You will then not be able to edit the
content of a link by clicking it, but you can move the cursor within a link
with the arrow keys.<br />
Other browsing preferences such as whether images should be loaded or not,
whether CSS style sheets should be applied or not, can be set in the
<strong>Browsing Preferences</strong> <a
href="Configure.html#Browsing">dialog</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use the keyboard to select links and to activate them. Key
<kbd>Tab</kbd> allows you to move to the next link or form field in the
document. <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> allows you to move to the previous link or form
field. <kbd>Alt &darr;</kbd> activates the current link. You can choose <a
href="ShortCuts.html">other keys</a> to perform these commands.</p>

<h3 id="Access">Access keys</h3>

<p>Access keys provide shortcuts for moving the cursor to a form field, an
area, or a link. This kind of access is crucial to people with motor
disabilities, but there are other conditions where it could be necessary or
useful.</p>

<p>When developing a web document, you can associate the <code>accesskey</code>
attribute with the following elements: <code>a</code>, <code>area</code>,
<code>button</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>label</code>,
<code>legend</code>, and <code>textarea</code>.</p>

<p>For example, if you associate the <code>accesskey</code> attribute with a
link in a document using <code>accesskey="n"</code> or
<code>accesskey="N"</code>, command <kbd>Alt-accesskey</kbd> (<kbd>Alt-n</kbd>
or <kbd>Alt-N</kbd> in this example) will activate that link (on MacOS X, use
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> instead of <kbd>Alt</kbd>). If the <code>accesskey</code>
attribute is associated to a form element, pressing <kbd>Alt-accesskey</kbd>
moves the focus to that element (or to the following element if associated with
a <code>label</code> or <code>legend</code> element).</p>

<p>Access keys overwrite Amaya shortcuts, but not the system shortcuts
(shortcuts for menus, for instance).</p>

<p>As an example, these Help pages declare the following access keys:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"n" for going to the next page</li>
  <li>"p" for going to the previous page</li>
  <li>"t" for the table of contents</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if you have assigned shortcut <kbd>Alt-p</kbd> to an Amaya command, this
shortcut won't work in a Help page; it will display the previous page
instead.</p>

<p>By default, Amaya uses the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key as the modifier for access
keys (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> on MacOS X). However, you can change this modifier using
the<strong></strong><strong>Preferences/General</strong> dialog box. You can
choose the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key instead of the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key for a
modifier, or you can disable the access key mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="Target">Target anchors</h3>

<p>Targets are elements that have been given an <code>id</code> attribute, or
anchors (element <code>a</code>) that have been given a <code>name</code>
attribute. They identify possible targets for links.</p>

<p>You can easily recognize targets and set links to them: Amaya allows you to
display target icons <img src="../images/target.gif" alt="Target icon" /> in
front of all targets. These icons are not part of the document and can be
displayed or hidden in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing <strong>Show targets</strong> from the <strong>Views</strong>
    menu.</li>
  <li>Using the default keyboard command (<kbd>Ctrl-u Ctrl-t</kbd>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Moving">Moving backward and forward</h3>

<p>Like most web browsers Amaya maintains a log to keep track of the pages you
have visited during the current session. You can move backward or forward
through pages in this log in several ways:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>File</strong> menu</td>
      <td>Choose <strong>Back</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu to
        view the previous page. 

        <p>Choose <strong>Forward</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu
        to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Keyboard shortcuts</td>
      <td><p>Press <kbd>Alt-&larr;</kbd> to view the previous page.</p>

        <p>Press <kbd>Alt-&rarr;</kbd> to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Navigation bar</td>
      <td>Click the back <img alt="Back "
        src="../../resources/icons/22x22/back.png" align="middle" /> button to
        view the previous page. 

        <p>Click the forward <img alt="Forward "
        src="../../resources/icons/22x22/forward.png" align="middle" /> button
        to view the next page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that each tab has a separate log.</p>

<p class="Note">If you have chosen a <a
href="Configure.html#Profile">profile</a> without the navigation feature, or if
you are in help pages, these commands are not available.</p>

<h3 id="Reloading">Reloading a page</h3>

<p>Documents can be reloaded by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choosing <strong>Reload document</strong> from the <strong>File</strong>
    menu.</li>
  <li>Using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl-r</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Clicking the <strong>Reload</strong> button <img
    src="../../resources/icons/22x22/reload.png" alt="reload" align="middle" />
    on the navigation bar.</li>
</ul>

<p class="Note">If you have chosen a <a
href="Configure.html#Profile">profile</a> without the navigation feature, or if
you are in help pages, this command is not available.</p>

<h2 id="Using">Using forms</h2>

<p>As Amaya is an editor, some of the widgets associated with HTML form
elements are different from those you are used to in browsers. This section
mentions the most notable differences.</p>

<h3 id="Simple">Simple menus</h3>

<p>To activate a selector such as this one:  
<select name="fruit">
  <option selected="selected">apple</option>
  <option>orange</option>
  <option>lemon</option>
  <option>banana</option>
  <option>strawberry</option>
</select>
 , you have to click twice on the current entry ("apple" here). This will
result in a popup widget showing all the entries. The widget can then be used
both with the keyboard and with the mouse.</p>

<p>With the keyboard, you must first select an entry using the arrow keys.
Pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key validates your choice. You can abort by
pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key at anytime.</p>

<p>With the mouse, there are two kinds of behavior. A single click allows you
to select an entry, whereas a double click on an entry means that you want to
activate this entry. To abort, you just need to click anywhere outside of the
pop-up widget. With very long menus, you can also use the scroll bar to quickly
navigate through the entries.</p>

<h3 id="Menus">Menus with multiple selections</h3>

<p>Some menus, like this one : 
<select name="fruit" multiple="multiple">
  <option>apple</option>
  <option>orange</option>
  <option>lemon</option>
  <option selected="selected">banana</option>
  <option selected="selected">strawberry</option>
</select>
 allow multiple entries to be selected simultaneously. This widget behaves much
like a <a href="#Simple">simple menu</a>. When the widget is activated, it
shows the current state of selection. You can abort by using either the
<kbd>Esc</kbd> key or by clicking elsewhere.</p>
