# Proposals

Proposals for new specification documents to be adopted by the WG are put here for discussion before being pulled into

The specifications are discussed on the WG [issue list](https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/issues).   
Please use appropriate *"Proposal: XXX"*  labels for new issues to help us sort them.
