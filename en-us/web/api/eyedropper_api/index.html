<p>The <strong>EyeDropper API</strong> provides a mechanism for creating an eyedropper tool. Using this tool, users can sample colors from their screens, including outside of the browser window.</p>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>Creative applications often allow users to sample colors from drawings or shapes in the application to reuse. Web applications can use the <strong>EyeDropper API</strong> to provide a similar eyedropper mode, provided by the browser.</p>
<p>Using the API, a web application can start the eyedropper mode. Once started, the cursor changes to indicate to the user that the mode is active. The user can then either select a color from anywhere on the screen, or dismiss the eyedropper mode by pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd>.</p>
<h2 id="security-and-privacy-measures">Security and privacy measures</h2>
<p>To prevent malicious websites from getting pixel data from a user’s screen without them realizing, the <strong>EyeDropper API</strong> implements the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API doesn’t let the eyedropper mode start without user intent. The {{domxref(“EyeDropper.prototype.open()”)}} method can only be called in response to a user action (like a button click).</li>
<li>No pixel information can be retrieved without user intent again. The promise returned by {{domxref(“EyeDropper.prototype.open()”)}} only resolves to a color value in response to a user action (clicking on a pixel). So the eyedropper cannot be used in the background without the user noticing it.</li>
<li>To help users notice the eyedropper mode more easily, it is made obvious by browsers. The normal mouse cursor disappears after a short delay and a magnifying glass appears instead. There is also a delay between when the eyedropper mode starts and when the user can select a pixel to ensure the user has had time to see the magnifying glass.</li>
<li>Users are also be able to cancel the eyedropper mode at any time (by pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key).</li>
