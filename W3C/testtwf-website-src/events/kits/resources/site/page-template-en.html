# ---------------------- TESTTWF EVENT PAGE TEMPLATE ---------------------------
#  
#  This is an English-only starter page for your event. Most of the content of 
#  your page will be defined in this header in YAML format between the 
#  --- separators  above and below. You are free to insert HTML anywhere in the 
#  page below the last --- separator. Follow the guidelines in each section 
#  to fill in the details of your event. You can look at other past event pages 
#  for examples of different ways to set them up. Note that this website 
#  structure was adopted after several event pages were already in place. Some 
#  events have only been partially converted to this new format.
#
#  To see built example of this starter page, see:
