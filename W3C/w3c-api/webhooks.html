<h1>Webhooks</h1>

<section>
    <p>
        Webhooks allow you to subscribe to certain events happening at W3C. When one of these events is triggered, we'll
        send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can configure your webhooks from <a href="https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/webhooks">your profile</a>.

    <h2>Events</h2>

    <p>
        When configuring a webhook, you can choose which events you would like to receive payloads for. You can change
        the subscribed events through the UI anytime.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each event corresponds to a certain set of actions that can happen. For
        example, if you subscribe to the publication event you'll receive detailed payloads every time a technical
        report
        is published.
    </p>

    <p>The available events are:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Publication (tr.published, tr.updated)</td>
            <td>Any time a technical report is published or its metadata are updated</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Group Participation (group.participant_joined, group.participant_left)</td>
            <td>Any time someone joins or leaves a group</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Connected Accounts (connected_account.created, connected_account.deleted)</td>
            <td>Any time someone connects their W3C account to an external service such as GitHub, or removes such a connection</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>This list of events will be progressively augmented.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Headers and Payloads</h2>

    <p>HTTP requests made to your webhook's configured URL endpoint will contain several special headers:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Header</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-W3C-Webhook</td>
            <td>Link to the webhook that triggered the delivery</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-W3C-Webhook-Id</td>
            <td>ID of the webhook that triggered the delivery</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Payload of HTTP requests consists in a JSON fragment including the event that triggered the webhook and one or
        several
        objects serialized in the same way as the <a href="https://api.w3.org/doc">API</a>.
    </p>
