# ---------------------- TESTTWF EVENT PAGE TEMPLATE ---------------------------
#  
#  This is an English-only starter page for your event. Most of the content of 
#  your page will be defined in this header in YAML format between the 
#  --- separators  above and below. You are free to insert HTML anywhere in the 
#  page below the last --- separator. Follow the guidelines in each section 
#  to fill in the details of your event. You can look at other past event pages 
#  for examples of different ways to set them up. Note that this website 
#  structure was adopted after several event pages were already in place. Some 
#  events have only been partially converted to this new format.
#
#  To see built example of this starter page, see:

<h2>About</h2>

If you live in the Portland area, are coming to town for <a href="http://2014.cascadiajs.com/">CascadiaJS 2014</a> and Dev Week PDX,
or just fancy a visit to the beautiful Rose City, come join us Sunday, August 3rd for 
Test the Web Forward Portland 2014.
<p>
    <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Portland_and_Mt_Hood.jpg" width="100%">
<p>
Serious front-end developers know that security is not just for server-side code anymore.  Come learn
how <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP">Content Security Policy</a> works to help stop XSS in your apps
from expert Ian Melven of New Relic, who contributed to the implementation for Mozilla Firefox.  Then
learn to write tests that will help you explore CSP, make it better and more interoperable, and perhaps
even find a bypass we haven't thought of yet.

     or after the template includes. Please do not edit the templates directly 
     for content that is specific only to your event.
