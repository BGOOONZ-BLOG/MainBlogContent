      <h3 id="intro_notation">Mathematics and its Notation</h3>
      
      
      <p>A distinguishing feature of mathematics is the use of a complex and
         highly evolved system of two-dimensional symbolic notation.  As
         J.&#xa0;R.&#xa0;Pierce writes in his book on communication theory,
         mathematics and its notation should not be viewed as one and the same
         thing [[Pierce1961]]. Mathematical ideas can exist independently of
         the notation that represents them. However, the relation between meaning
         and notation is subtle, and part of the power of mathematics to describe
         and analyze derives from its ability to represent and manipulate ideas in
         symbolic form. The challenge before a Mathematical Markup Language (MathML)
         in enabling mathematics on the World Wide Web
         is to capture both notation and content (that is, its meaning) in such a way
         that documents can utilize the highly evolved notation of written
         and printed mathematics as well as the new potential for interconnectivity in
         electronic media.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mathematical notation evolves constantly as people continue
         to innovate in ways of approaching and expressing ideas. Even
         the common notation of arithmetic has gone through an amazing
         variety of styles, including many defunct ones advocated by leading
         mathematical figures of their day [[Cajori1928]]. Modern
         mathematical notation is the product of centuries of refinement, and
         the notational conventions for high-quality typesetting are quite
         complicated and subtle. For example, variables and letters which stand for
         numbers are usually typeset today in a special mathematical italic
         font subtly distinct from the usual text italic; this seems to have been
         introduced in Europe in the late sixteenth century.  Spacing around
         symbols for operations such as +, -, &#xd7; and / is slightly
         different from that of text, to reflect conventions about operator
         precedence that have evolved over centuries.
         Entire books have been devoted to the conventions of
         mathematical typesetting, from the alignment of superscripts and
         subscripts, to rules for choosing parenthesis sizes, and on to
         specialized notational practices for subfields of mathematics.  The 
         manuals describing the nuances of present-day computer typesetting and 
         composition systems can run to hundreds of pages.</p>
      
      
      <p>Notational conventions in mathematics, and in printed text in general,
         guide the eye and make printed expressions much easier to read and
         understand. Though we usually take them for granted, we, as modern readers,
         rely on 
         numerous conventions such as paragraphs, capital letters, font
         families and cases, and even the device of decimal-like numbering of
         sections such as is used in this document.  
         Such notational conventions are perhaps even more important
         for electronic media, where one must contend with the difficulties of
         on-screen reading.  Appropriate standards coupled with computers
         enable a broadening of access to mathematics beyond the world of 
         print. The markup methods for mathematics in use 
         just before the Web rose to prominence importantly included T<sub>E</sub>X
         (also written <code>TeX</code>) [[Knuth1986]]
         and approaches based on SGML ([[AAP-math]], [[Poppelier1992]] and [[ISO-12083]]).
         </p>
      
      
      <p>It is remarkable how widespread the current
         conventions of mathematical notation have become. The general
         two-dimensional layout, and most of the same symbols, are used
         in all modern mathematical communications,
         whether the participants are, say, European, writing left-to-right,
         or Middle-Eastern, writing right-to-left.  Of course, conventions
         for the symbols used, particularly those naming functions and
         variables, may tend to favor a local language and script.
         The largest variation from the most common is a form used in
         some Arabic-speaking communities which lays out the entire
         mathematical notation from right-to-left, roughly in mirror image
         of the European tradition.</p>
      
      
      <p>However, there is more to putting mathematics on the Web
         than merely finding ways of displaying traditional
         mathematical notation in a Web browser. The Web represents a
         fundamental change in the underlying metaphor for knowledge
         storage, a change in which <em>interconnection</em>
         plays a central role. It has become important to
         find ways of communicating mathematics which facilitate
         automatic processing, searching and indexing, and reuse in
         other mathematical applications and contexts. With this
         advance in communication technology, there is an opportunity
         to expand our ability to represent, encode, and ultimately to
         communicate our mathematical insights and understanding with
         each other. We believe that MathML as specified below is an important step in
         developing mathematics on the Web.</p>

         <h4 id="intro_goals">Design Goals of MathML</h4>
         
         
         <p>MathML  has   been  designed  from the beginning with  the  following
            ultimate goals in mind.</p>
         
         
         <p>MathML should ideally:
            </p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Encode mathematical material suitable for all educational
                  and scientific communication.
                  </p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Encode both mathematical notation and mathematical meaning.</p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Facilitate conversion to and from other mathematical
                  formats, both presentational and semantic. Output formats should include:
                  </p>
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>graphical displays</p>
                     </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>speech synthesizers</p>
                     </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>input for computer algebra systems</p>
                     </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>other mathematics typesetting languages, such as T<sub>E</sub>X</p>
                     </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>plain text displays, e.g. VT100 emulators</p>
                     </li>
                  
                  <li>
                     
                     <p>international print media, including braille</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               
               <p>It is recognized that conversion to and from other notational
                  systems or media may entail loss of information in the process.</p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Allow the passing of information intended for
                  specific renderers and applications.</p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Support efficient browsing of lengthy expressions.</p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Provide for extensibility.</p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Be well suited to templates and other common techniques for editing formulas.</p>
               </li>
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Be legible to humans, and simple for software to generate and process.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         
         
         <p>No matter how successfully  MathML achieves its goals as
            a markup language, it is clear that MathML is useful only
            if it is  implemented well. The W3C Math Working
            Group has identified a short list of additional implementation
            goals. These  goals attempt to describe  concisely the minimal
            functionality MathML rendering  and processing software should
            try to provide.
            </p>
         
         
         <ul>
            
            
            <li>
               
               <p>MathML expressions in HTML (and XHTML) pages should render
                  properly in popular Web browsers, in accordance with reader and author
                  viewing preferences, and at the highest quality possible given the
                  capabilities of the platform.</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               
               <p>HTML (and XHTML) documents containing MathML expressions should
                  print properly and at high-quality printer resolutions.</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               
               <p>MathML expressions in Web pages  should be able to  react to
                  user  gestures, such those as  with a  mouse,  and to coordinate
                  communication  with  other applications through   the
                  browser.</p>
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
               
               <p>Mathematical expression editors and converters should be developed
                  to facilitate the creation of Web pages containing MathML
                  expressions.</p>
            </li>
            
            </ul>
         
         
         <p>The extent to which these goals are ultimately met depends on the
            cooperation and support of browser vendors and other developers. The W3C
            Math Working Group has continued to work with other working groups of the W3C,
            and outside the W3C, to ensure that the
            needs of the scientific community will be met.
            MathML 2 and its implementations showed considerable progress in this area 
            over the situation that obtained at
            the time of the MathML 1.0 Recommendation (April 1998) [[MathML1]].  MathML3 and the developing Web are expected to 
            allow much more.</p>

      <h3 id="intro_overview">Overview</h3>
      
      <p>
         <span>MathML is a markup language for describing mathematics.
            It is usually expressed in XML syntax, although HTML and other syntaxes are possible.</span>
         A special aspect of MathML is that there are two main strains of markup:
         Presentation markup, discussed in <a href="#presm"></a>,
         is used to display mathematical expressions;
         and Content markup, discussed in <a href="#contm"></a>,
         is used to convey mathematical meaning.
         Content markup is specified in particular detail.   
         This specification makes use of
         <span>an XML</span>
         format called Content Dictionaries
         This format has been developed by the
         OpenMath Society, [[OpenMath2004]] with the dictionaries being used by this specification involving joint development
         by the OpenMath Society and the W3C Math Working Group.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>Fundamentals common to both strains of markup
         are covered in <a href="#fund"></a>,
         while the means for combining these strains,
         as well as external markup, into single MathML objects
         are discussed in <a href="#mixing"></a>.
         How MathML interacts with applications is covered
         in <a href="#world-interactions"></a>.
         Finally, a discussion of special symbols,
         and issues regarding characters, entities and fonts,
         is given in <a href="#chars"></a>.</p>

      <p>
         The quadratic formula provides a 
         simple but instructive illustration of MathML markup.
         </p>
      
      <blockquote>
         <p><img src="image/f1002.gif" alt="x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}"></img></p>
      </blockquote>
      
      
      <p>MathML offers two flavors of markup of this formula.  The first is
         the style which emphasizes the actual presentation of a formula, the 
         two-dimensional layout in which the symbols are arranged. An example 
         of this type is given just below. The second flavor
         emphasizes the mathematical content and an example of it follows the first one.

         Consider the superscript 2 in this formula.  It represents the squaring operation
         here, but the meaning of a superscript in other situations depends on
         the context.  A letter with a superscript can be used to signify a particular 
         component of a vector, or maybe the superscript just labels a different 
         type of some structure.  Similarly two letters written one just after the 
         other could signify two variables multiplied together, as they do in the 
         quadratic formula, or they could be two letters making up the name of a 
         single variable.   What is called Content Markup in MathML allows closer
         specification of the mathematical meaning of many common formulas.  The
         quadratic formula given in this style of markup is as follows.
