This directory contains a working example for invocation of RMLProcessor.

See ./attempts/attempt-1/gigs.sh 

Goal is to match schema.org data e.g. https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/4620133?hl=en as
Google currently gets from JSON-LD markup.

The RML/R2RML is in attempts/attempt-1 ( dir created by Dan Brickley with lots of help from Anastasia Dimou )

TODO: attempt-2 should try same thing but with a mustache-based approach.
