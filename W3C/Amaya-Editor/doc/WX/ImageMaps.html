<h2 id="Using">Using image and maps</h2>

<h3 id="Adding">Adding an image</h3>

<p>To insert an image, choose <strong>Image</strong> from the
<strong>Insert</strong> menu, click the image <img
src="../../resources/icons/16x16/XHTML_Image.png" alt="Image button" /> button,
or use the keyboard shortcut (<kbd>Ctrl-h</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl-i</kbd>). The
resulting dialog lets you enter </p>
<ul>
  <li>the file name</li>
  <li>the <a href="#About">alternate text</a> (<code>alt</code> attribute) of
    the image</li>
  <li>and the position (inline, on the left side, centered, on the right
  side)</li>
</ul>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: the alternate text is mandatory. You
must provide a short description of the image in the corresponding field or
confirm twice.</p>

<p>To help find an image file you can enter a filter, and use the filter
button, and the dialog will list only the files that match your pattern.</p>

<p>To provide a long description for an image presenting complex information,
you should do so in a separate document and link it by providing the URI as a
<code>longdesc</code>. This command is also available on the
<strong>Attributes</strong> list.</p>

<h3 id="Replacing">Replacing an image</h3>

<p>If an image is selected (do so by dragging over the image) when opening the
image dialog, the selected image is then <em>replaced</em> by the new image.</p>

<h3>Resizing an image or a map area</h3>

<p>After you have inserted an image or defined an area within an image map, you
may need to resize it.</p>

<p>To resize the image or map area directly on the screen:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the image or the area of the image map to display handles.
    <p>When you click on an image, Amaya selects the left or right border of
    the image to let you insert a text before or after the image. </p>
    <p>To display image handles, you have to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>either select a border and press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>F2</kbd>,</li>
      <li>or drag over the image</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When selecting a handle with the left button of the mouse and moving the
    mouse with the left button down you are able to resize the image or the
    area as you want.
    <ul>
      <li>Corner handles let you resize both the width and the height.</li>
      <li>If the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key down, the ratio between the width and the
        height of the image is kept.</li>
      <li>Other handles let you resize either the width or the height.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You may also edit attributes.</p>

<h3 id="About">About alternative text and long descriptions</h3>

<p>Without useful alternate text for images, many web pages become difficult or
even impossible to navigate, and users are left "feeling their way in the
dark."</p>

<p>To prevent this problem, you must provide alternate text for elements such
as images and other multimedia objects. The alternate text is usually presented
instead of the image by a browser with a voice output system, or on a Braille
display used by many people who are blind. It is also common for users with
low-quality connections to request the alternate view, because text is
transmitted much faster than images.</p>

<p>The alternate text should replace the image in function as well. For
example, if you use the image as an icon that links to a reference point, then
the title of the reference itself is a good alternate text.</p>

<p>There are cases where an image is used for purely visual effect, and does
not add any information value to the page. In this case, it is appropriate to
use a blank alternate text, although you must still define it.</p>

<p>When the image conveys important information that is not available from the
text of the document, you must provide a description of the information. The
<code>longdesc</code> option in the <strong>Attributes</strong> tool enables
you to link a description to the image. This description can be a URI (a
separate document), or named part of the current document.</p>

<p>To view how a page might be presented without the images, use show alternate
(<span class="Link0"><strong>Views /Show alternate</strong></span>). If the
page is spoken by a voice output system, then the <a
href="Views.html#Alternate">alternate view</a> might simply be read out.</p>

<h3 id="Using1">Using client-side image maps</h3>

<p>Amaya enables you to use client-side image maps.</p>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To activate an area in an image map</p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click on the area within the image. Amaya finds the URI associated
    to this area, and opens it in the browser.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ProcedureCaption">To display the existing areas within an image
map</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select <strong>Show map areas</strong> from the <strong>Views</strong>
    menu.<br />

    <p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong>   You can also display existing
    areas directly from the keyboard with <kbd>Ctrl-u
    Ctrl</kbd><kbd>-m</kbd>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
