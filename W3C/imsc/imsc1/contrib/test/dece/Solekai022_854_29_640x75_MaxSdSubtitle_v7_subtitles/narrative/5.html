      <td>A new series of five image subtitles appears: a ‘moon’ moving from upper left to lower right, and then returning to
      the upper left. The top, middle, and bottom images have a white background, and the other two images have no background
      (video can be seen through the "hole").<br>
      <img src="6.png"><br>
      Overall, the change in positioning is even, without skips in the sequence.<br>
      The "moon" continues to move from upper left to lower right, with the following background colors matching up with each
      image:<br>
      Fuchsia (upper left)<br>
      No background (middle upper left)<br>
      Yellow (center)<br>
      No background (middle lower right)<br>
      Cyan (lower right)<br>
      No background (middle lower right)<br>
      Yellow (center)<br>
      No background (middle upper left)<br>
