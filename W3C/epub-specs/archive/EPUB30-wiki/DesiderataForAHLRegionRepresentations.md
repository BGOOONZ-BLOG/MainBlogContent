This wiki page is intended to summarize desiderata for the representation of regions as discussed in the charter.


# Details #

Desiderata for AHL region representations:

**1. region information should be described in relative coordinate** (FUJIFILM)

Modification of image file size depending on its resolution should be enbaled.
This is made possible by regiion informtion described in relative coordinate

**2. Regions of complex shapes can be expressed** (FUJIFILM)

e.g. a balloon in the frame of manga

**3. Dependency of the region can be expressed** (FUJIFILM)

e.g. frame and balloon of manga, Region of Interest

**4. Scaleability** (FUJIFILM)

We soluld keep in mind that EPUB fixed layout contents having no region information are produced in large quantities.
It is desirable to be able to easily add or change region information or transition effects against these contents.
