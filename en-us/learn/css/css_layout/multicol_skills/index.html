<p>The aim of this task is to get you working with the CSS {{CSSxRef(“column-count”)}}, {{CSSxRef(“column-width”)}}, {{CSSxRef(“column-gap”)}}, {{CSSxRef(“column-span”)}} and {{CSSxRef(“column-rule”)}}  properties and values covered in our lesson on <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Multiple-column_Layout">Multiple-column Layout</a>. You will be working through three small tasks which use different elements of the material you have just covered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch(“Assessment or further help”)}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="multicol-one">Multicol One</h2>
<p>In this task you need to create three columns, with a 50px gap between each column.</p>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<h2 id="multicol-two">Multicol Two</h2>
<p>Create columns which have a minimum width of 200px.</p>
<p>Then, add a 5px, grey rule between each column, ensuring there is 10px of space between the edge of the rule and the column content.</p>

<h2 id="multicol-three">Multicol Three</h2>
<p>Cause the element containing the heading and subheading to span across all columns so it looks like the image.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-or-further-help">Assessment or further help</h2>
<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors mentioned above.</p>
<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
<li><p>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A descriptive title such as “Assessment wanted for Multicol skill test 1”.</li>
<li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
<li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it’s very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can’t see their code.</li>
<li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
