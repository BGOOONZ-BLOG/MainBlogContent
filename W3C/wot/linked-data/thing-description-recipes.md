Thing Description Recipes
=========================

Problem Statement
-----------------
- Interop client creates a WoT application based on a recipe. Things, required to implement a recipe, can be discovered automatically based on their Thing Descriptions and the recipe semantic specification.

Tasks
------
- Propose a recipe format based on TD and capability templates 
- Implement a prototype

Demonstrate
-----------
- Discovery of recipes for rapid creation of WoT applications
- Discovery of recipe ingredients (Things matching recipe requirements)
- Semantic interoperability, cross-domain choreography of Things

Proposal
-------
- The current status of the work can be found [here](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/master/linked-data/contributions/thing-description-recipes).
