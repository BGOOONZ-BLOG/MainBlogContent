          Implementers need to be aware that this specification is not stable
          and may change in incompatible ways. We anticipate that it will be
          updated to be based on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sensors/">
          Generic Sensor API</a>.

          Implementers interested in implementing this specification should
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/proximity">subscribe to the

        The functionality described in this specification was initially
        specified as part of the
        <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/default/sensor-api/Overview.html">
        Sensor API</a> but has been extracted in order to be more
        straightforward to implement, and in order to produce a specification
        that could be implemented on its own merits without interference with
        other features.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The <a>DeviceProximityEvent</a> interface provides web developers
        information about the distance between the hosting device and a
        nearby object.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a>UserProximityEvent</a> interface provides web developers
        a user-agent- and platform-specific approximation that the hosting
        device has sensed a nearby object.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is achieved by interrogating a proximity sensor of a device, which
        is a sensor that can detect the presence of a physical object without
        physical contact. Not all devices contain a proximity sensor, and when
        there is no proximity sensor, this API is still exposed to the
        scripting environment but it does nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because most proximity sensors detect electromagnetic radiation (e.g.,
        an infrared light or a magnetic field), certain material properties can
        interfere with the sensor's ability to sense the presence of a physical
        object. Things that can interfere with a sensor include, but are not
        limited to, the material's translucency, reflectiveness, color,
        temperature, chemical composition, and even the angle at which the
        object is reflecting the radiation back at the sensor. As such,
        proximity sensors should not be relied on as a means to measure
        distance: the only thing that can be deduced from a proximity sensor is
        that an object is somewhere in the distance between the minimum sensing
        distance and the maximum sensing distance with some degree of
        certainty.

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the
        interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs
        defined in this specification must implement them in a manner
        consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL
        specification [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that
        specification and terminology.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The <code><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#eventhandler">
        EventHandler</a></code> interface represents a callback used for event
        handlers as defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The concepts <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">
        queue a task</a></dfn>,
        <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#fire-a-simple-event">
        fires a simple event</a></dfn>, and <dfn>
        <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">
        top-level browsing context</a></dfn> are defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Event constructor behavior is defined in
        <dfn><a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#constructing-events">
        constructing events</a></dfn> chapter in [[!DOM4]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handlers">
        event handlers</a></dfn> and
        <dfn><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#event-handler-event-type">
        event handler event types</a></dfn> are defined in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The concepts <dfn>
        <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#constructing-events">
        create an event</a></dfn> and <dfn>
        <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#firing-events">
        fire an event</a></dfn> are defined in [[!DOM4]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>current device proximity</dfn> is a value that represents the
        proximity of the hosting device to a physical object (i.e., some value
        between the <a>maximum sensing distance</a> and the <a>minimum sensing
        distance</a>), in centimeters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>minimum sensing distance</dfn> at which the sensor can detect
        a physical object, in centimeters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>maximum sensing distance</dfn> at which the sensor can detect
        a physical object, in centimeters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>current user proximity state</dfn>, a boolean state, is a
        user-agent- and platform-specific approximation of the closeness of a
        physical object with the hosting device.

      <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy risks can arise when this specification is used in
        combination with other functionality or when used over time,
        specifically with the risk of correlation of data and user
        identification through fingerprinting. Web application developers
        using these JavaScript APIs should consider how this information might
        be correlated with other information and the privacy risks that might
        be created. The potential risks of collection  of such data over a
        longer period of time should also be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variations in implementation limits of minimum and maximum sensing
        distance as well as event firing rates offer the possibility of
        fingerprinting to identify users. Browser implementations may reduce
        the risk by limiting the granularity and event rates available to web
        application developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same JavaScript code using the API can be used simultaneously in
        different window contexts on the same device it may be possible for
        that code to correlate the user across those two contexts, creating
        unanticipated tracking mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browser implementations should consider providing the user an
        indication of when the sensor is used and allowing the user to disable
        sensing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web application developers that use this specification should perform a
        privacy assessment of their application taking all aspects of their
        application into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The events defined in this specification are only fired in the
        <a>top-level browsing context</a> to avoid the privacy risk of
        sharing the information defined in this specification with contexts
        unfamiliar to the user. For example, a mobile device will only fire
        these events on the active tab, and not on the background tabs or
        within iframes.
