<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Interoperability of devices and services for the Internet of Things (IoT) with cloud platforms and services at a worldwide scale is a huge challenge. 
</p>

<p>
Recent developments in electronics have dramatically reduced the cost for devices functioning as tags, sensors, and actuators for the physical environment, i.e., the Internet of Things. The market potential for IoT devices and services is currently held back by fragmentation due to a plethora of communication technologies and the lack of a common approach to combining devices and services across different protocols, domains, and standards. There is no a common way to describe and combine semantic behavior. 
</p>

<p>
RESTful Web technologies have become very important in recent years, such as HTTP, JSON, and JavaScript combined with open standards for data formats, interface definitions, and access control.
</p>

<p>
  The mission of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> activities is to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of Things by forming a Web-based abstraction layer capable of interconnecting existing IoT platforms, devices, and cloud services and complementing available standards. Baseline specifications have been developed by the Web of Things Working Group during the last two years to define an architecture and a common format for describing devices and services. 
</p>

<!--<p><a href="iot.png"><img src="iot.png" alt="TODO: TODO: Create a current picture of Web of Things domains" id="wot-domains" /></a></p>-->

<p id="use-cases">
There is a wide range of application domains including the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Smart Home</li>
<li>Smart Cities Environmental Monitoring</li>
<li>Health: at home and in hospitals</li>
<li>Manufacturing and Process Automation</li>
<li>Supply Chain Management and Retail</li>
<li>Construction and Building Information Modeling (BIM)</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Telecommunication</li>
<li>Machine-to-Machine communication (M2M)</li>
<li>Utilities: electricity, water, gas, drainage</li>
<li>Energy Management and Smart Grid, Smart Appliances</li>
<li>Disaster Control: floods, fires, earthquakes, and civil disturbances</li>
<li>Security and Privacy</li>
<li>Cross-domain applications combining the domains listed above</li>
</ul>

<p>
To achieve the goal for cross-platform interoperability, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">W3C Web of Things Working Group</a> has finalized a first set of standardized building blocks. They are based upon rich metadata that describes the data and interaction models exposed to applications, and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively. During the course of the Web of Things standardization activities, the following specifications were created: 
</p>
	
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">WoT Architecture</a></li> 
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-scripting-api/">WoT Scripting API</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-binding-templates/">WoT Binding Templates</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security/">WoT Security and Privacy Considerations</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
A W3C Workshop is now planned for mid 2019 to disseminate the findings and discuss the way forward with a wider set of stakeholders. To unlock the potential of an open ecosystem and open markets, the workshop will discuss how to reduce fragmentation of the IoT landscape and the future direction of the open W3C WoT standardization. A focus is on exposing and consuming services across specific IoT technologies to enable new use cases, such as common monitoring and control of assets from multiple vendors, interconnecting different application domains, and building digital twins of physical devices.
</p>

<p>
The workshop is free, although you will need to submit a brief expression of interest or a longer position paper. See How to participate.
