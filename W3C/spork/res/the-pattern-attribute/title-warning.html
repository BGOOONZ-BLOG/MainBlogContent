<p class="warning">
  Relying on the <code><a href="#attr-title">title</a></code> attribute for the visual display 
  of text content is currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner 
  as required by this specification (e.g. requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to appear,
  which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or
  tablet).
