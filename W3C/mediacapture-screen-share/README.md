### Published Versions

While we have taken measures to reduce the frequency of build breakages, the tip-of-tree
of this document may contain work in progress changes and other inconsistencies.
If you want to review something more coherent, review the latest editors' draft;
these are published at intervals on the order of weeks.

* [Tip of tree as HTML](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-screen-share/)
* [Latest published editor's draft at github](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-screen-share/)
* [Latest W3C published version](https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/) (automatically updated; should be identical to the latest editors' draft)

To Reflow the Spec
