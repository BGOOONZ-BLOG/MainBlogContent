# Topic: OCF #

Zip 64 patent encumbrance?  More than 65K files, or bigger than 4GB single file.  With multi-media, can't really punt.

OCF Abstract container -> either Zip container or File System container

Remove File System Container as a valid OCF instance, possible?

Tentative remove File System Container (and absolute URI's in OPF) for EPUB3, but start an effort to address network accessible EPUB publications.  **Agreed**

It is expected that a list of external media types (e.g. audio, video, external metadata, html links) that could be directly pointed to from markup (or OPF in metadata case), and not in the OCF (e.g. streamed), could be incorporated into the markup specifications.
