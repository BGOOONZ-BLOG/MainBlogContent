    <section id="Problem Statement">
      <h2>Probem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The W3C web payment specification should provide mechanism to ensure the authenticity of the payment app. This includes several aspects:
      </p>
      <li>
        <p>
          Problem 1: The payment app should be the one as it claims to be.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Problem 2: How to prevent fake/malicious payment app to do malicious things, for example, phishing etc.
        </p>
      </li>

      <p>
        Draft  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/blob/gh-pages/proposals/zach-pmi.md">Payment Method Identifiers</a> discusses the identifiers of payment apps. For the proprietary systems, the draft proposes to use URL as the identifier of the payment app. Origin is used to ensure the authenticity of the payment app. However, origin based authenticity management can only solve problem 1 and can not solve problem 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Case 1: Phishing attack
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let us assume AlicePay.com is a famous payment service provider, AlicePay1.com is a fake one of AlicePay.com, the hacker may hack the merchant website and insert AlicePay1.com in the merchant website. The merchant website will recommend AlicePay1.com to the user to register it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, recommended payment apps may be used as a channel for phishing attacks where users are duped into registering malicious apps (possibly following hack of merchant website).
      </p>
      <p>
        Using origin based authenticity management can not solve this problem, since the payment API will indeed access the same origin of the malicious payment app as its registered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Case 2:
      </p>
      <p>
        When the user install a payment app through some other mechanism that does not involve origin (e.g., native app), origin based authenticity management can not work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use Case 3:
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case that the browser invoking native payment app, if the native app is a fake one and if there is no mechanism to prevent the browser from invoking the fake native app, this may lead to risk of user data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Secure invoke web payment app">
      <h2>Secure Invoke Web Payment App</h2>
        <p>
          In this proposal, a verification file which contains the digital signature of the payment app identifier is used for the authenticity management of payment app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The verification file is located at a specific path in the payment app website. The path is generated by the browser based on the payment app name and identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in the use case as discussed in section 2.1, a verification file named verify.sign is located in the path AlicePay.com/pay/verify/.
        </p>
        <p>
          The browser should verify the signature information when invokes the payment app in addition to origin check. This solution can solve both problem 1 and problem 2 as described in section 1.1.
        </p>
        <p>
           <pre class="example highlight">
              File verify.sign:
                  {
                     name: 'AlicePay',
                     identifier: ['https://AlicePay.com/pay'],
                     certificate: '.....',
                     signature: '...'
                   } 
          </pre>             
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="Secure invoke native payment app">
      <h2>Secure Invoke Native Payment App</h2>
        <p>
          To secure the invoking of native payment app from browser, the browser can verify the signature of native payment app. As one example that shown in the following figure, the browser downloads the payment-app.json from the payment app owner's website and verify the native payment app's signature that contains in the payment-app.json file. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This mechanism can prevent the browser from invoking a malicious payment app.
