<h1>[DRAFT] Web Technology Accessibility Guidelines Checklist</h1>
<p>This is a draft checklist to support <a href="wtag.html">Web Technology Accessibility Guidelines (WTAG)</a> prepared by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a>. The goal of WTAG is to describe the features that web technologies should provide to ensure it is possible to create content that is accessible to users with disabilities. The full Web Technology Accessibility Guidelines references an analysis of user requirements, describes how technologies, content authoring, and user agents work together to meet these needs, and provides comprehensive guidance to technology developers. This checklist extracts that information at a high level to aid in self-review of technologies. Specification developers can use this to help ensure the technology will address features likely to be raised during horizontal review from accessibility proponents.</p>
<p>Web technologies address a variety of needs, and play a variety of roles in web accessibility. Content languages describe primary content, styling languages impact presentation, APIs enable manipulation and data interchange, and protocols tie it all together. Each of these types of technologies can impact accessibility. </p>
<p>This checklist is organized by types of features that a technology may provide. If the technology provides such a feature, the checklist items under the heading are applicable and should be examined. If the technology does not provide such a feature, the checklist items under the heading are not applicable and can be passed over.</p>
<p>Note on name: the name of this checklist may be changed. A current proposal is "Framework for Accessibility in the Specification of (Web) Technologies" (FAST).</p>
