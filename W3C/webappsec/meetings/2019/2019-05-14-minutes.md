## WebAppSec WG - 2019-05-14

Present: mkwst, wseltzer, bhill2, dveditz, moneill, terri, jeffh, jugglinmike, francois, tanvi, weiler

Agenda: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/blob/master/meetings/2019/2019-05-14.agenda.md

### Minutes

* Approve last call's minutes: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/blob/master/meetings/2019/2019-04-17.minutes.md

mkwst: first order of business, approving the minutes. Any objections? .... hearing none minutes are approved.

### Agenda Bashing?

mkwst: \[pointing ahead to current agenda items] anything else to add?

moneill: HTTP state tokens

mkwst: let's add that into the cookie discussion

### CSP & Trusted Types

* https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/pull/170

mkwst: trusted types layers on top of the DOM. You can ask the browser to stop you from using strings; audit more carefully. That's explained in the spec.

... here, can you use trusted types to deal with eval in CSP?

... enable devs who know what they're doing to do safe eval. 

... if we allow devs to create a trusted script object, let them use that without unsafe-eval.

... Mike Samuel put together PR with algos to fold into CSP and ECMAscript to make this mechanism work. What do y'all think? is this reasonable to pursue, implement?

moneill: If you get script from somewhere on your page, would this control that?

mkwst: you can create a list of safe sources for scripts. e.g. from my CDN, or matches hash or token. Traditionally, we don't have way to distinguish safe from unsafe uses of eval, because it's just a string. This gives us more discrimination.

mkwst: don't need to decide here, but wanted to point people to that discussion

dveditz: I worry that someone could inject something that creates trusted objects and uses that to inject their scripts.

terri: sounds intriguing. worst case if people do bad trusted types is basically the same as existing unsafe behaviour.

### XSLeaks

https://github.com/xsleaks/xsleaks/wiki/Browser-Side-Channels

mkwst: browser side-channels doc describes many ways DOM APIs leak info that they shouldn't. Some deeply baked into platform, like read number of frames x-origin, and e.g., page where user is signed in, different # of frames from non-signed-in

... sometimes if a page has search results it will have a different number of frames. This is unfortunate. 

... lots of attack surface. Document goes through a wide variety of things, some of which will be hard to change. At Google we get a lot of reports of these kinds of attacks and we've been fixing them as one-offs. I suspect many of you get these as well.

... Folks at Google have been looking at these issues and think we need new primitives. eg "cross origin opener policy", for example. make it difficult for someone else to get a handle to your window, which makes it harder to implement some of these attacks (e.g. no window ref, no window.frames.length).

... we'll want fetch-metadata, to give servers more info about way a request is being made: e.g. subresource, frame vs top-level navigation with user-gestures

... dealing with cache, want a way to ensure some resource is not in the cache.  Clear cache, cause a navigation, then probe for resource. Chrome and FF both exploring ways to partition HTTP cache similar to what Safari has been doing

https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/904 <-- double-keyed cache

... above is a relatively short discussion about it. Chrome has it behind a flag, testing for perf impact which is non-zero. need more experimentation. 

... Security researchers are doing lots of interesting work. Can we as community think about changes to the platform to make attacks less viable; and primitives to make category of attack less capable than today. 

... Causing real issues for companies today. 

bhill: +1. Facebooks sees the same thing. We need some systematic fixes.

dveditz: Mozilla interested in exploring and possibly implementing; e.g. flag that Tor browser uses turns on double-keying. Does cause perf hits.

mkwst: party isolation partitions more than the cache, that's what breaks things

dveditz: it would be good to break that out. 

mkwst: issues 902, 903 against Fetch. small things to make it more difficult to execute some of today's attacks. whac-a-mole, but fix problems today. 

... 902, request-init. reducing attackers' control of cache reload
... 903, limit length of referer header. one of the few things attackers have complete control over. Extending the length of URL to 65k, make servers unhappy. We should be able to limit that length, probably under 2k. Would address one specific vector in use today?

dveditz: cap referer header or push state?

mkwest: probably referer. Suggest you add to the bug. 

dveditz: we've seen abuses against the browser, push-state. 

mkwest: \[insert why-not-both meme]

dveditz: HTTP WG could cap all the headers. Cookies can bomb servers too

mkwest: look at the wiki.

* COOP + Fetch Metadata + Partitioned cache = Ok?

### SMS & `autocomplete=one-time-code`

* https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/152

mkwst: I've linked to Mozilla's standard position repo discussion about Chrome's proposal to standardize on the autocomplete=one-time-code attribute. SMS second factor isn't the best, but it's commonplace and is significantly better than not having a second factor at all. iOS has built something into the platform so that if a text looks like a code iOS adds it to the keyboard as an easy choice to enter into a text field. Android doesn't have this. Browsers would need to request SMS permission to read messages to emulate this.

... it's also phishable, unfortunately.

https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview

... idea of the sms-retriever api is to have android route SMS to an application that is specified in the SMS. We could perhaps extend this to specifying an origin in an SMS and having that route to the browser.

... folks in chromium have proposed a more imperative API

bhill2: one piece of feedback I've heard is that we don't always know if the users phone is for an iOS or Android device. People on iOS see the android code at the end of the message and wonder what it is. Would be nice if that were standardized enough for the platforms to show the same.

mkwst: there are two different cases, logging in on the phone that will get the message vs logging in on a desktop with the text going to the phone in my hand.

bhill2: in many markets the phone might be the only device so optimizing for that case would help.

mkwst: thanks, will come back with further thoughts



### Cookies


* https://mikewest.github.io/cookie-incrementalism/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism.html
* https://mikewest.github.io/cookie-samesite-firstparty/draft-west-cookie-samesite-firstparty.html
* https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/pull/800
* HTTP State Tokens

mkwst: starting with HTTP State Tokens proposal: 

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-http-state-tokens-00
* https://github.com/mikewest/http-state-tokens

* https://speakerdeck.com/mikewest/cookies-are-bad-at-http-workshop-2019

... "cookies are bad", "something else would be better". I'm not entirely convinced HTTP State Tokens are THE replacement for cookies, but I want to push on it and see if we can work our way to something that COULD replace cookies.

... we can all agree cookie defaults are bad. Not "secure", delivered on every request (whether made by you or someone else), exposed to JavaScript, inefficient (bloated headers) (1 out of 1000 cookie headers are 10K in size). Bad for privacy and security.

... "Good" cookies are hard to understand for authors. I define good cookies as \_Host- cookies: secure, host-only, path=/. Missing SameSite and httponly though.

... HTTP State Tokens combine all this and the only way to set and use them is the "safe" way.

moneil: I like the proposal. I added an issue about timeouts based on user inactivity.

bhill2: We're still often using schemes that leak sensitive info in a GET request URL, like OAuth tokens. Could switch to POST, but we'd need these endpoints to be OK with a non-SameSite request, but otherwise want those cookies protected when sent to other URLs on the same site.

bhill: OAuth widely used, 10 years of vulnerabilities using GET to transfer artifacts (tokens, etc). Side channels (referrer headers, fragment reattach). Maybe we could do something like CORS preflight where we say "This is a point that expects to receive an access token via POST, looks like CSRF, but isn't!"

mkwst: This is with regard to `SameSite`, right?

bhill: `SameSite=Lax` certainly, but anything coming in the future that has similar properties. We sometimes need to POST between logically different entities (e.g. for federated login).

moneill: First-Party Sets?

bhill: FPS is not a workaround. Need to allow distinct parties to POST in some use cases.
   

mkwst: incrementalism -- we'll (soon?) start treating cookies as "sameSite=lax" by default. To get around this sites would have to explicitly use SameSite=none. Defaults mean sites not paying attention will be magically protected from CSRF.

... we've noticed in Chrome that a lot of users clear all their cookies very often. This results in a bad experience since it clears "good site" state while clearing out all the unwanted "bad site" cruft.

... We could then collectively build something on top of the fact that only samesite=none cookies could track you, and maybe give different controls for those cookies vs others.

... could also take advantage and require SameSite=None cookies to also be Secure cookies. If you want other sites to use you then you shouldn't be preventing other sites from moving to https.

mkwst: Mike O'Neill mentioned "first party sets" (link below). If you haven't please look at it. The next link I posted relies on that concept. This is an option somewhere between SameSite=None and SameSite=lax/strict. Allows cooperative sites, but not others, to share cookies. E.g. Google and Youtube, Apple and iCloud.

https://github.com/mikewest/first-party-sets - mkwst thinks this should be part of origin policy
