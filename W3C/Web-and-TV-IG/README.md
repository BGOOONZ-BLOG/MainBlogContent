# Web and TV Interest Group

**Note:** Since [rechartering in 2017](https://www.w3.org/2017/03/webtv-charter.html), this group was renamed as the
Media & Entertainment Interest Group, and this repository is no longer active. Please refer to the
[Media & Entertainment Interest Group's GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/media-and-entertainment)
for current work in the group.

This is the Github repository of the former W3C Web and TV Interest Group (Web&TV IG) used to organize work in the IG.
Higher-level information about the Web&TV IG is available on [the charter](http://www.w3.org/2012/11/webTVIGcharter.html)
and [the main home page of the group](http://www.w3.org/2011/webtv/). The Interest Group reviews existing work and
identifies requirements and potential solutions for the Web and TV. The development of Web standards, when required,
takes place in other working groups.
