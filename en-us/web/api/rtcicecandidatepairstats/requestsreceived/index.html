<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>An integer value which specifies the number of STUN connectivity and/or consent requests that have been received to date on the connection described by this pair of {{Glossary(“ICE”)}} candidates.</p>
<p>Because there’s no way to tell the difference between requests made to check connectivity and requests made to check consent, the returned figure includes both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The reported number of requests includes retransmissions. If a request had to be repeated due to network issues, it will be counted multiple times here. This differs from {{domxref(“RTCIceCandidatePairStats.requestsSent”, “requestsSent”)}}, which <em>does not</em> include retransmisions.</p>
