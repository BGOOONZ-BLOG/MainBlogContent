# W3C-LinkChecker

This distribution contains the W3C Link Checker.

The link checker can be run as a CGI script in a web server as well as
on the command line.  The CGI version provides a HTML interface as
seen at [http://validator.w3.org/checklink](http://validator.w3.org/checklink).


## Install

To install the distribution for command line use:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/w3c/link-checker.git
cd link-checker
#if you have cpanminus installed
cpanm --installdeps .
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install # as root unless you are using local::lib
```

To install the CGI version, in addition to the above, copy the
bin/checklink script into a location in your web server from where
execution of CGI scripts is allowed, and make sure that the web server
user has execute permissions to the script.  The CGI directory is
typically named "cgi-bin" somewhere under your web server root
directory.

For more information, please consult the POD documentation in the
checklink.pod file, typically (in the directory where you unpacked the
source):

```sh
perldoc ./bin/checklink.pod
```

...as well as the HTML documentation in docs/checklink.html.

## As a Docker container

You may want to use [@stupchiy](https://github.com/stupchiy)'s [Dockerfile](https://github.com/stupchiy/docker-w3c-checklink/blob/master/Dockerfile), which is
based on Ubuntu Linux, and follow his instructions:

```sh
$ docker build -t link-checker .                                                                        # Build an image
$ docker run -it --rm link-checker                                                                      # Run a container
$ docker run -it --rm link-checker checklink https://foo.bar                                            # Run script directly
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/home/checklink link-checker checklink -H https://foo.bar > report.html # Write to HTML file
```
