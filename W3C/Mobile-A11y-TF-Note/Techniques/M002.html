      <p>The problem with sizes set by many of the vendor guidelines is that   the guidelines are overlooked when it comes to text content that is read   by touch with screen readers turned on. One such example is the   information strip at the top of the iPhone where we see Signal strength,   Carrier name, Time, Percent loaded, Battery left and other items has a   very small vertical height. With VoiceOver on these are not buttons but   text that gets focus when touched and read to the user. Another example   is on an 8 inch Windows 8 tablet when the user goes to the historic   Windows screen. All of the app status icons (battery, wireless network,   signal strength, speaker status, etc.) on the left side in the Taskbar   are well under the Windows recommended size and are very hard to touch   correctly without a stylus or mouse. </p>
      <h2><span id="Description">Description</span></h2>
      <p>The objective of this advisory technique is to define an adequate   touch target size for mobile device UI components - ensuring that touch   targets are large enough to touch accurately without magnification. </p>
      <p>This technique applies to icons, links and buttons used for navigation and activating functions. </p>
      <p>The minimum recommend touch target size is 9mm high by 9 mm wide   and is not dependent on the screen size, device or resolution and not   requiring screen magnification to obtain that size. </p>
      <h2><span id="Examples">Examples</span></h2>
      <p>Examples of this technique include but are not limited to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Top navigation buttons as seen on iOS devices. </li>
        <li> Icons along the bottom of the screen as seen on Windows 8 native app. </li>
        <li> Command links as seed on the bottom of Android devices. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        This technique is discussed in the design documents listed below from various vendors of mobile devices. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> iOS Human Interface Guidelines: Adaptivity and Layout recommends minimum target sizes of 44 pixels wide 44 pixels tall. </li>
        <li> Interactions and usability with Windows Phone: Touch Targets has   recommendations for a touch target size of 34px with a minimum touch   target size of 26px. </li>
        <li> Android Developers: Metrics and Grids recommends targets be at   least 48dp high and wide so that they will never be smaller than a   minimum recommended target size of 7mm. </li>
      </ul>

        <li> step 1 - Turn on native device screen reader or a 3rd party screen reader if applicable. </li>
