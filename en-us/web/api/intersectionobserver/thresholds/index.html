<p>{{APIRef(“Intersection Observer API”)}}{{draft}}</p>
<p>The {{domxref(“IntersectionObserver”)}} interface’s read-only <strong><code>thresholds</code></strong> property returns the list of intersection thresholds that was specified when the observer was instantiated with {{domxref(“IntersectionObserver.IntersectionObserver”, “IntersectionObserver()”)}}. If only one threshold ratio was provided when instanitating the object, this will be an array containing that single value.</p>
<p>See {{SectionOnPage(“/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API”, “Thresholds”)}} to learn how thresholds work.</p>

<h3 id="value">Value</h3>
<p>An array of intersection thresholds, originally specified using the <code>threshold</code> property when instantiating the observer. If only one observer was specified, without being in an array, this value is a one-entry array containing that threshold. Regardless of the order your original <code>threshold</code> array was in, this one is always sorted in numerically increasing order.</p>
<p>If no <code>threshold</code> option was included when <code>IntersectionObserver()</code> was used to instantiate the observer, the value of <code>thresholds</code> is <code>[0]</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the <code>options</code> object you can specify when creating an {{domxref(“IntersectionObserver”)}} has a field named {{domxref(“IntersectionObserver.threshold”, “threshold”)}}, this property is called <code>thresholds</code>. Confusing? Yes. If you accidentally use <code>thresholds</code> as the name of the field in your <code>options</code>, the <code>thresholds</code> array will wind up being <code>[0.0]</code>, which is likely not what you expect. Debugging chaos may ensue.</p>
