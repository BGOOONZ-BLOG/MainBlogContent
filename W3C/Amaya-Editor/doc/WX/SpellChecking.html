<h2 id="Checking">Checking spelling</h2>

<p>Amaya provides a multilingual spell checker and selects the appropriate
language according to the <code>lang</code> attribute. The <code>lang</code>
attribute can be associated with any element in a document, even with a
single word, using the <a
href="Attributes.html"><strong>Attributes</strong></a> tool.</p>

<p>To spell check a document, choose <strong>Check spelling</strong> from the
<strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>

<h3 id="personal">The personal dictionary</h3>

<p>When you register a new word, the spell checker creates or updates the
<b>user's personal dictionary</b>. A user's personal dictionary is located in
the <code>AmayaHome/dictionary.DCT</code> file. In read-write mode, the spell
checker uses the user dictionary when checking all documents, in addition to
the language-specific dictionaries. When you click the <strong>Learn</strong>
button in the <strong>Spell checking</strong> dialog, the user dictionary is
created, if does not already exists, and automatically updated by the
spelling checker.</p>

<h3 id="spell">The spell check dialog</h3>

<p>The <strong>Tools / Check spelling</strong> command displays a dialog that
enables you to choose parameters and interact with the spell checker.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The top left field displays an incorrect word. The list of proposed
    corrections is displayed in the selector field located below the
    incorrect word. By default, Amaya selects the first proposed correction.
    To select another correction, simply click it. The selected correction is
    displayed below the selector field. This correction can be edited on
    there. The correction is made when you click the <strong>Replace and
    next</strong> button.<br />
    Note that you can also perform the correction by double-clicking a
    proposed correction.</li>
  <li>The <strong>language</strong> in which the correction is made is
    specified in the bottom left corner of the dialog. To change language,
    apply a <code>lang</code> attribute to the text with the
    <strong>Attributes</strong> tool, and restart the spell checker.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Ignore</strong> section tells the spell checker to ignore
    certain words, for example, words that contain only capital letters,
    words that contain digits, Roman numerals or words with special
    characters (you can choose the special characters).</li>
  <li>The <strong>Checking</strong> section, similar to that in the <a
    href="Searching.html">Search dialog</a>, enables you to specify the part
    of document on which the checker will work.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Running">Running the spell checker</h3>

<p>Before running the spell checker, make sure the current selection is in
the document you want to check. For the spell checker, the source code is
different from the formatted document. If the current selection is in the
source view, all the markup will be checked, including tags, attributes, etc.
If the selection is in the formatted view, only the content of the document
will be checked.</p>

<p>To start the checker, click the <strong>Search/Skip</strong> button at the
bottom of the dialog. If an error is found, the incorrect word is selected
and highlighted in the document. If no error was detected a message "End of
spell checking" is displayed at the bottom of the dialog.</p>

<p>When an incorrect word is detected, you can use a button on the dialog to
perform the following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Search/Skip</strong>: The incorrect word is acceptable. No
    change is made in the text or in the dictionaries. The checker searches
    for the next error.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn</strong>: Performs the same action as the
    <strong>Search/Skip</strong> button, except that the word considered
    incorrect is added to the user's personal dictionary, and the checker
    will ignore any subsequent occurrence of this word.</li>
  <li><strong>Replace and next</strong>: Amaya replaces the incorrect word
    with the correct word (optionally edited) and the checker searches for
    the next error.</li>
  <li><strong>Close</strong>: Amaya closes the dialog box and stops spell
    checking. Previous corrections are not canceled.</li>
</ul>
