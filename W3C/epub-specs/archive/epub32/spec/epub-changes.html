			<p>This document describes changes made in the second minor revision of the EPUB® 3 specifications,
				highlighting key changes and additions.</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>EPUB is an interchange and delivery format for digital publications, based on XML and Web Standards. An
				EPUB Publication can be thought of as a reliable packaging of Web content that represents a digital
				book, magazine, or other type of publication, and that can be distributed for online and offline
				consumption. </p>

			<p>EPUB 3.2 is a minor revision of the EPUB 3 specification, which can be considered as a successor to both
				EPUB 3.0.1 and EPUB 3.1. EPUB 3.1 did not receive wide adoption, and the Community Group decided to
				create EPUB 3.2 to be strongly backward-compatible with EPUB 3.0.1, while retaining many of the changes
				made in EPUB 3.1 (A given version of EPUB is said to be strongly backwards-compatible with an older
				version if and only if any EPUB publication conformant to the older version is also conformant to the
				newer version).</p>

			<p>This document describes all changes to EPUB made since EPUB 3.0.1, so that readers do not have to review
				EPUB 3.1 before being able to determine how this new version updates EPUB 3.0.1. </p>

			<p>This document is non-normative. Consult the <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-intro-epub-specs">EPUB
					specifications</a> for definitive information on EPUB 3.</p>

			<p>Unless otherwise specified, terms used herein have the meaning defined in <a
					href="epub-spec.html#sec-terminology">Terminology</a> [[EPUB32]].</p>

		</section>
		<section id="overview">
			<h1>Overview</h1>

			<p>Most existing EPUB 3.0.1 files should validate as EPUB 3.2 with no changes, 
			and so content authors should not need to change their workflows and processes. 
			EPUB 3.2 does provide a few more options, and formally recommends 
			that content creators follow the EPUB Accessibility Guidelines.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Changes to the underlying web standards of HTML, CSS, and SVG 
			can affect validity, as well as changes to <a href="https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck">EPUBCheck</a>.</p>
			</div>


			<p>The biggest change in EPUB 3.2 is the relationship to the core web specs of HTML, CSS, and SVG. In the
				past EPUB has pointed to a particular dated version of HTML or CSS. EPUB 3.2 now officially supports the
				current versions of HTML, CSS, and SVG, as defined by the W3C. These versions will evolve over time,
				allowing EPUB to remain up-to-date with the web.</p>

			<p>Another noticeable change is that WOFF 2.0 and SFNT fonts are now Core Media Type Resources. EPUB 3.2
				also deprecates some older features, such as <code>bindings</code>, <code>epub:trigger</code>, and
					<code>epub:switch.</code></p>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-reorg">
			<h1>Specification Reorganization</h1>

			<p>To simplify reading and referencing of the EPUB standard, a major reorganization of the specifications
				was undertaken. Foremost among the changes, a new umbrella <a href="epub-spec.html">EPUB
					specification</a> was introduced as the primary point of entry. EPUB Publication and Reading System
				requirements that were formerly defined in [[Publications301]] were moved to this new top-level
				specification, as was the section on <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-publication-resources">Publication
					Resources</a>. All <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-terminology">common terminology</a> were collected
				into this top-level specification, as well, to provide a common point of reference. An <a
					href="epub-spec.html#index">index of key concepts</a> and terms was also added to aid navigation of
				the various sub-specifications.</p>

			<p>[[Publications301]] was renamed to <a href="epub-packages.html">EPUB Packages 3.2</a> [[Packages32]] to
				better reflect that it defines Renditions of content through the Package Document. The EPUB Navigation
				Document definition was moved from [[ContentDocs301]] to the Packages specification as it is a central
				component of a Package and not a general feature of EPUB Content Documents. Property definitions
				previously defined within this specification were moved out to external vocabularies.</p>

			<p>[[MediaOverlays32]] also has its embedded property definitions moved to a separate vocabulary, but is
				otherwise unchanged structurally.</p>

			<p>[[ContentDocs32]] underwent mostly cosmetic changes outside of the removal of the EPUB Navigation
				Document definition. Some sections are renamed to better reflect that they are not unique document types
				but ways of enhancing content documents (e.g., the section "Scripted Content Documents" was changed to
				"Scripting"), but otherwise the arrangement of sections remains largely unchanged.</p>

			<p>[[OCF32]] similarly underwent some minor editorial and structural cleanup, but no sections were added or
				removed.</p>

						>issues in the EPUB 3.0.1 specification</a> addressed in EPUB 3.2.</p>
			</div>

			<section id="sec-epub32-a11y">
				<h2>Accessibility Support</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 includes a recommendation that all EPUB Publications conform to the new EPUB Accessibility
					Specification [[EPUBAccessibility]]. The accessibility specification makes recommendations for the
					inclusion of discovery metadata along with [[WCAG20]] support in content.</p>

				<p>EPUB Reading Systems are also recommended to meet the requirements in [[EPUBAccessibility]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-cmt">
				<h2>New Core Media Type Resources</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 adds the <a href="epub-spec.html#cmt-woff2">WOFF 2.0</a> and <a
						href="epub-spec.html#cmt-sfnt">SFNT</a> font formats as Core Media Type Resources
					[[EPUB32]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-fallbacks">
				<h2>Clarification of Foreign Resource Fallbacks</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 adds an additional clarification that foreign resources <a
						href="epub-spec.html#sec-foreign-restrictions">do not require fallbacks</a> if they are not in
					the spine and not embedded in EPUB Content Documents.</p>
				<p>This change will allow authors to include data files for use by scripts without unnecessary
					fallbacks, among other benefits.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-res">
				<h2>Remotely-Hosted Resources</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 allows fonts and resources used by scripts to be <a
						href="epub-spec.html#sec-resource-locations">hosted outside the EPUB Container</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-cfi">
				<h2>Removed support for EPUBCFI for linking</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 removes the requirement for Reading Systems to support EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifiers
					[[EPUB-CFI]] for hyperlinking (cf. the <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#confreq-rs-cfi">EPUB 3.0.1
						EPUBCFI requirement</a>).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-deprecated">
				<h2>New Designations for Unsupported Features</h2>
				<p>EPUB 3.2 <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-overview-unsupported">updates</a> the definition of deprecated,
					removes “superseded,” and adds the concept of “legacy” features, intended only for backward
					compatibility. </p>

			<h1>Packages 3.2</h1>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Refer to the issue tracker for a complete list of clarifications, typos and other issues in the EPUB

						>3.2 revision</a></p>
			</div>


			<section id="sec-pkg-metadata-changes">
				<h2>Package Metadata Changes</h2>
				<p>EPUB 3.2 makes the following changes to package metadata:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <a href="epub-packages.html#spread-values"><code>portrait</code> value</a> of the
							<code>rendition:spread</code> attribute is deprecated.</li>
					<li>The <a href="epub-packages.html#viewport"><code>rendition:viewport</code></a> property is
						deprecated.</li>
					<li>The <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-meta-auth"><code>meta-auth</code></a> property is deprecated.</li>
					<li>The <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-display-seq"><code>display-seq</code></a> property no longer applies to <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-opf-dccreator">creators</a>. Display precedence now follows document order.</li>
					<li>The <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-authority"><code>authority</code></a> and <a
							href="epub-packages.html#sec-term"><code>term</code></a> properties have been added for use
						with the <code>dc:subject</code> element.</li>
					<li>All of the specialized metadata record <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-link-rel">relationships
							for link element</a> are now deprecated (<code>marc21xml-record</code>,
							<code>mods-record</code>, <code>onix-record</code>, and <code>xmp-signature</code>). Use of
						the general <code>record</code> relationship is now preferred. The <code>properties</code>
						attribute has also been added to the link element to help identify <a
							href="epub-packages.html#sec-link-properties">record types without a unique media
						type</a>.</li>
					<li>The <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-alternate"><code>alternate</code></a>, <a
							href="epub-packages.html#sec-acquire"><code>acquire</code></a>, 
							and <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-voicing"><code>voicing</code></a>  link relationships were
						added.</li>
					<li>External metadata vocabularies have been reintegrated into the specification as appendixes.</li>
					<li><code>epubsc</code> (for scriptable components) is no longer a reserved prefix.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-pkg-linked-records">
				<h2>Linked Metadata Records</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 also changes the precedence order of linked records, <a
						href="epub-packages.html#sec-link-elem">prioritizing bibliographic information in linked
						records</a> over the information included directly in the Package Document <code>metadata</code>
					element.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A protocol for retrieving remote records was under development in an appendix in the last draft.
						That work has been removed and will be continued in a separate document.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-pkg-bindings">
				<h2>Deprecation of the <code>bindings</code> Element</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 <a href="epub-spec.html#deprecated">deprecated</a> use of bindings in the Package Document
					to provide an alternative scripted fallback for foreign resources embedded in an object element (cf.
						<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-bindings-elem">EPUB 3.0.1
							<code>bindings</code></a>).</p>
				<p>The [[HTML]] <code>object</code> element's <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-fallbacks"
						>intrinsic fallback mechanism</a> (embedded content) can be used to provide a fallback Core
					Media Type Resource.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="sec-cdoc">
			<h1>Content Documents 3.2</h1>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Refer to the issue tracker for a complete list of clarifications, typos and other issues in the EPUB
					Content Documents specification addressed in the <a
						href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-epub-revision/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22EPUB32%22+label%3ASpec-ContentDocs+is%3Aclosed"
						>3.2 revision</a></p>
			</div>

			<section id="sec-cdoc-undated">
				<h2>Undated References to HTML and SVG</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.0.1 used dated reference to HTML 5.0 and SVG 1.1, which tied the specification to those
					specific versions. Under this model, a new revision was required each time a version of HTML or SVG
					was introduced.</p>

				<p>To ensure that that EPUB 3.2 remains up to date with the latest recommended versions of these
					specifications, the dated references have been replaced with undated references in EPUB 3.2. This
					change means that as new recommended versions of HTML and SVG are published, they are immediately
					valid for use in EPUB Publications.</p>

				<p>As a result of this change, the restriction against the use of animation elements and events in SVG
					is removed, but Authors should use caution with these and other features of SVG that are not yet
					well supported.</p>

				<p>For more information, see <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-overview-relations-html">Relationship to
						HTML</a> and <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-overview-relations-svg">Relationship to
					SVG</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-cdoc-css">
				<h2>Replacement of EPUB Style Sheets with CSS References</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 removes the EPUB Style Sheets profile. In its place, more general <span class="phrase"><a
							href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-css">CSS support requirements</a></span> are being
					defined:</p>

				<div class="itemizedlist">
					<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
						<li>
							<p>CSS support is now required for visual Reading Systems.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Rather than a CSS profile, EPUB 3.2 uses the “official definition” of CSS from the CSS
								Working Group Snapshot.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The restriction on the use of <code>position: fixed</code> is removed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The restriction on the use of <code>position: absolute</code> is removed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>All <code>-epub-</code> prefixed properties from CSS Speech are removed due to lack of
								implementations.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The <code>-epub-ruby-position</code> property is removed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The <code>-epub-text-combine-horizontal</code> property is removed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The <code>-epub-fullsize-kana</code> property is removed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The <code>-epub-text-emphasis</code> shorthand property is removed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The <code>use-glyph-orientation</code> and <code>sideways-left</code> values of <span
									class="property">-epub-text-orientation</span> are removed.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The <code>oeb-page-head</code> and <code>oeb-page-foot</code> values of the <span
									class="property">display</span> property are removed. These were deprecated in EPUB 3.0.1.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p class="note">It is not EPUB’s role to enforce restrictions on stylesheets 
				used in EPUB Publications. CSS has well-defined error handling, 
				and many techniques (such as `@supports` and the cascade) are available to authors 
				so that they can take advantage of newer CSS features 
				while ensuring reasonable fallback behavior.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-cdoc-css-priority">
				<h2>Prioritization of Author and User Styles</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 adds guidance that Reading Systems should prioritize the style choices of Authors and users
					over its own user agent styles through the addition of <a
						href="epub-contentdocs.html#confreq-css-rs-html-default">Reading System conformance
						requirements</a> and a <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-css-rs-overrides">subsection on
						overriding styles</a>.</p>

			</section>


			<section id="alternate-style-tags">
				<h2>Alternate Style Tags Removed</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 no longer mentions Alternate Style Tags. As this mechanism uses class attributes, this has
					no impact on the validity of existing content.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="structural-semantics">
				<h2>Any value for <code>epub:type</code> allowed</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 allows unprefixed values that are not part of the EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary
					[[EPUB-SSV]] to be used in the <code>epub:type</code> attribute. </p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-cdoc-scripting">
				<h2>Scripting Support Clarifications</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 makes the following changes to <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-scripted-content"
						>scripting support</a>:</p>

				<div class="itemizedlist">
					<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">

							<p>Container-constrained scripting is limited to the [[HTML]] <code>iframe</code> element
								(removed <code>embed</code> and <code>object</code>).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Reading Systems should support container-constrained scripting (down from "must" because
								of security and privacy concerns around scripting)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Reading Systems should support spine-level scripting in fixed layout documents and the
								"scrolled-doc" and "scrolled-continuous" interfaces defined by the <a
