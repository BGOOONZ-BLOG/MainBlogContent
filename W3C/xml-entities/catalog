<!--
  An XML Catalog that rewrites any reference to the files at URI
  starting with

   http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/

  to similarly named files in the local directory

  /etc/xml/w3c-entities

  It should be edited to refer the local copy of the
  entity files on your machine.

  This reduces the load on the W3C servers and improves parse times
  by removing the need to fetch the entity definitions over the network.
