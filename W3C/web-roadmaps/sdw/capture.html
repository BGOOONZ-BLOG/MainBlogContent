      <h1>Capture spatial data</h1>
      <p>There are different scenarios in which spatial data is captured, i.e. created. When interaction with a web browser or a mobile device concerns a <em>location</em>, for example the current location, the user is in a sense capturing spatial data. Usually this involves a sensor such as a GPS device in some way. Sensor platforms often create spatial data as they capture location along with other measurements of their environment. </p>

        <div data-feature="Geolocation">
            <p>The <a data-featureid="geolocation">Geolocation API</a> provides a common interface for locating the device, independently of the underlying technology (GPS, Wi-Fi networks identification, triangulation in cellular networks, etc.).</p>

          <div data-feature="Sensor API">
              <p>The <a data-featureid="sta-sensing">Sensing</a> feature of the OGC SensorThings API allows IoT devices and applications to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (i.e., HTTP POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE) Internet of Things (IoT) data and metadata in a SensorThings service. It is designed based on the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/32574.html">ISO/OGC Observations and measurements</a> (O&amp;M) model. The geographical Locations of Things are useful in almost every application and as a result are included as well.</p>

        <div data-feature="Orientation">
            <p>The <a data-featureid="orientation">Orientation Sensor</a> features allows the monitoring of a device's physical orientation in relation to a stationary 3D Cartesian coordinate system. This feature is part of the Motion Sensors feature described in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/mobile/sensors.html">Roadmap of Web Applications on Mobile</a>.</p>

          <!--APIs based on the Generic Sensor API-->
            <p>The <a data-featureid="geolocation-sensor">Geolocation Sensor</a> is an API for obtaining geolocation reading from the hosting device. The feature set of the Geolocation Sensor is similar to that of the Geolocation API, but it is surfaced through the Generic Sensor API, allows continuous geotracking and geofencing (one-time alerts when a user crosses a specific area) operations in the background, improves security and privacy, and is extensible.</p>
