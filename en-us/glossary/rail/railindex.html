<p><strong>RAIL</strong>, an acronym for <strong>Response, Animation, Idle, and Load</strong>, is a performance model originated by the Google Chrome team in 2015, focused on user experience and performance within the browser. The performance mantra of RAIL is “Focus on the user; the end goal isn’t to make your site perform fast on any specific device, it’s to make users happy.” There are 4 stages of interaction: page load, idle, response to input, and scrolling and animation. In acronym order, the main tenets are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response</strong>
<ul>
<li>: Respond to users immediately, acknowledging any user input in <strong>100ms</strong> or less.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Animation</strong>
<ul>
<li>: When animating, render each frame in under <strong>16ms</strong>, aiming for consistency and avoiding jank.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Idle</strong>
<ul>
<li>: When using the main JavaScript thread, work in chunks for less than <strong>50ms</strong> to free up the thread for user interactions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Load</strong>
<ul>
<li>: Deliver interactive content in less than <strong>1 second</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
