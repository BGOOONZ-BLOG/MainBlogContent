## Clipboard Events spec

This repository contains the specification for Clipboard Events.

The editor's draft is live on [https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/](https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/) and the latest W3C Technical Report is [http://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/](http://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/).

Tests for the spec are maintained inside the source code of the spec itself. They are extracted and built into a test suite by running TC-generator/tc-gen.py. When [web-platform-tests/pull/1242](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/1242) is done, the tests will live in the web-platform-tests repo.

Contributions welcome - both tests and suggested edits.
Because this specification is written using [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed), all edits should be made to the `index.bs` file.
The `index.html` file can then be generated by running the `bikeshed` command (with no arguements) in the repo directory.
If you cannot run Bikeshed, you can still submit pull requests with edits to just the `bikeshed.bs` file and someone will follow up with a CL that generates the appropriate HTML.

This specification formerly used W3C's CVS repository but [that repo](http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2006/webapi/clipops/) is no longer used for this specification.
