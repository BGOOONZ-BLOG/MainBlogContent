<h3 id="about">About the Markup Validator</h3>
    <h4 id="clickedandlost">Help me! I clicked on an icon and ended up on this strange site!</h4>
      <p>Don't panic!</p>

      <p>
	The author of the Web page you come from once used our service
	to <em>validate</em> that page, and the page passed validation. 
	The author was then authorized to use the icon on that page, as
	a claim of <em>validity</em>. The icon is used as a link back to
	the validation service, so that the author can <em>revalidate</em>
	whenever necessary. This is why, by clicking on the icon, you 
	followed a link to the current <em>validation results</em> for
	the page you came from.
      </p>

      <p>
	The validation result was certainly positive ("this page is valid..."),
	but if it wasn't, you would probably do the author of the page where
	the icon was a favor if you could warn him/her of this abnormal situation.
      </p>


      <p>
	If you are curious about Markup validation you may read this
	help document further, or you may simply use the back button
	of your Web browser to come back to the page where you found 
	the "valid" icon.
      </p>

    <h4 id="validation_basics">What is <em>Markup Validation</em>?</h4>
      <p>Most pages on the World Wide Web are written in computer languages
	(such as <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>)
	that allow Web authors to structure text, add multimedia content, and
	specify what appearance, or style, the result should have.</p>

     <p>As for every language, these have their own <em>grammar</em>, <em>vocabulary</em>
	and <em>syntax</em>, and every document written with these computer languages
	are supposed to follow these rules. The (X)HTML languages, for all versions up 
	to XHTML 1.1, are using machine-readable grammars called 
    <abbr title="Document Type Definition">DTD</abbr>s, a mechanism inherited from
	<a href="sgml.html"><abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr></a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, Just as texts in a natural language
	can include spelling or grammar errors, documents using Markup languages
	may (for various reasons) not be following these rules.
    The process of verifying whether a document actually follows the rules for the
	language(s) it uses is called <em>validation</em>, and the tool used for that
	is a validator. A document that passes this process with success is called 
	<em>valid</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>With these concepts in mind, we can define "markup validation" as the process of 
    checking a Web document against the grammar (generally a DTD) it claims to be using.</p>
        

    <h4 id="validandquality">Is validation some kind of quality control? 
	Does "valid" mean "quality approved by W3C"?</h4>

      <p>Validity is one of the quality criteria for a Web page, but there are
	many others. In other words, a <em>valid</em> Web page is not necessarily
	a good web page, but an <em>invalid</em> Web page has little chance
	of being a good web page.</p>

     <p>For that reason, the fact that the W3C Markup Validator says that
	one page passes validation does <strong>not</strong> mean that
	W3C assesses that it is a good page. It only means that a tool (not 
	necessarily without flaws) has found the page to comply with a specific
	set of rules. No more, no less. This is also why the "valid ..." icons 
	should never be considered as a "W3C seal of quality".</p>

    <h4 id="validandconform">Is validity the same thing as conformance?</h4>
      <p>
        No, they are different concepts. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Markup languages are defined in <em>technical specifications</em>, 
        which generally include a <em>formal grammar</em>.
        A document is valid when it is correctly written in accordance
        to the formal grammar, whereas conformance relates to the
        specification itself. The two <em>might</em> be equivalent, but in most cases, 
        some conformance requirements cannot be expressed in the grammar, making validity
        only a part of the conformance.
      </p>

    <h4 id="what-is-it">What is the Markup Validator and what does it do?</h4>
      <p>
	The Markup Validator is a free tool and service that 
        <a href="#validation_basics">validates markup</a>: 
        in other words, it checks the syntax of Web documents, written in formats 
        such as (X)HTML.
      </p> 
      <p>
	The Validator is sort of like <code>lint</code> for C. It compares
        your HTML document to the defined syntax of HTML and reports any
        discrepancies. 
      </p>

    <h4 id="why-validate">Why should I validate my HTML pages?</h4>
      <p>
        One of the important maxims of computer programming is: <q>Be
        conservative in what you produce; be liberal in what you accept.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        Browsers follow the second half of this maxim by accepting Web pages
        and trying to display them even if they're not legal HTML. Usually
        this means that the browser will try to make educated guesses about
        what you probably meant. The problem is that different browsers (or
        even different versions of the same browser) will make different
        guesses about the same illegal construct; worse, if your HTML is
        <em>really</em> pathological, the browser could get hopelessly
        confused and produce a mangled mess, or even crash.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why you want to follow the first half of the maxim by making
        sure your pages are legal HTML. The best way to do that is by
        running your documents through one or more HTML validators. 
      </p>
      <p>A <a href="why.html">lengthier answer</a> to this question is
	also available on this site if the explanation above did not satisfy 
	you.
      </p>

    <h4 id="who-does-validator">Who owns/maintain the Markup Validator?</h4>
      <p>The Markup Validator is maintained at <abbr
	title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> by W3C staff and 
	benevolent collaborators, who receive a lot of help from contributors
	(read the <a href="../about.html#credits">full credits</a>).
      </p>

    <h4 id="others">What other validators are there?</h4>

	<p>
	Looking for validators at W3C, but not the Markup Validator?
	Check out the list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators">validators at W3C</a>,
	including well-known <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a>,

<h3 id="using">Using this service</h3>

    <h4 id="manual">How do I use this service?</h4>
      <p>Most probably, you will want to use the online Markup Validation service.
	The simple way to use this service to validate a Web page is to paste its 
	address into the <a href="../#uri">text area</a> on the 
	<a href="..">validator's home page</a>, and press the "Check" button.</p>
      <p>There are other possible uses and a few usage options, please
	read the <a href="users.html">user's manual</a> for further help with this
	service.
      </p>
      <p>
	If, for some reason, you prefer running your own instance of the Markup Validator,
	check out our <a href="devel.html">developer's documentation</a>.
      </p>

    <h4 id="errors">What are these error messages?</h4>
      <p>The output of the Markup Validator may be hard to decipher for
	newcomers and experts alike, so we are maintaining a <a 
	href="errors.html">list of error
	messages and their interpretation</a>, which should help.
     </p>

    <h4 id="munged-doctype">Many error messages? Don't panic.</h4>
      <p>
        Don't panic. Did The Validator complain about your
        <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration (or lack thereof)? Make sure your
        document has a syntactically correct <code>DOCTYPE</code>
        declaration, as described in the <a href="sgml.html#doctype">section
        on <code>DOCTYPE</code></a>, and make sure it correctly identifies
        the type of HTML you're using. Then run it through The Validator
        again; if you're lucky, you should get a lot fewer errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this doesn't help, then you may be experiencing a cascade failure
        &mdash; one error that gets The Validator so confused that it can't
        make sense of the rest of your page. Try correcting the first few
        errors and running your page through The Validator again. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Be patient, with a little time and experience you will learn to use the 
	Markup Validator to clean up your HTML documents in no time.
      </p>

    <h4 id="cleanup">I don't want error messages, I want you to clean up my page!</h4>
      <p>
        Have a look at tools such as
        <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a> and
        <a href="http://www.tidyp.com/">tidyp</a>. When selected, the
        "Clean up Markup with HTML-Tidy" option will output a "cleaned"
        version of the input document in case it was not valid, done with
        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Tidy/">HTML-Tidy</a>, using
        the Markup Validator's default HTML-Tidy configuration. Note that there
        are no guarantees about the validity or other aspects of that output,
        and there are many options to configure in these tools that may result
        in better clean up than the Validator's default options for your
        document, so you may want to try out them locally.

<h3 id="very-faq">Miscellaneous (Very) Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <h4 id="faq-doctype">No DOCTYPE Declaration Found!</h4>
      <p>
        A DOCTYPE Declaration is mandatory for HTML documents.
      </p>

    <p>Unless you have very specific needs, you should use the following generic DOCTYPE: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. A typical HTML document looks like:
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;

          &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;

        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;!-- ... body of document ... --&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;

      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    <h4 id="faq-charset"><q>No Character Encoding Found! </q></h4>

      <p>An HTML document should be served along with its character encoding.</p>

      <p>Specifying a character encoding is typically done by the web server
	configuration, by the scripts that put together pages, and inside the
	document itself. <a href="http://www.iana.org/"><abbr title="Internet Assigned Numbers Authority">IANA</abbr></a> 
    maintains the list of
	<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">official names for character
	encodings</a> (called charsets in this context). You can choose from a number
	of encodings, though we recommend UTF-8 as particularly useful.</p>

	<p>The W3C <abbr title="Internationalization">I18N</abbr> Activity has collected a 
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/International/O-charset">few tips on
	how to do this</a>.</p>
	
    <p>
      To quickly check whether the document would validate after addressing
      the missing character encoding information, you can use the "Encoding"
      form control (accesskey "2") earlier in the page to force an encoding
      override to take effect. "iso-8859-1" (Western Europe and North America)
      and "utf-8" (Universal, and more commonly used in recent documents) are
      common encodings if you are not sure what encoding to choose.
    </p>



    <h4 id="faq-referer">/check?uri=referer does not work - or - the validator says it does not support 
    my "undefined" URL scheme</h4>

      <p>Browsers and other Web agents usually send information about the page they come from, in a 
      <code>Referer</code> header. The validator uses this information for a features that allows 
      it to validate whatever page the browser last visited. The "valid" icons on some Web page usually
      point to the validation of the page using this feature.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, some zealous "security software" or Web proxies strip the referrer 
      information from what the browser sends. Without this information the validator is not able to
      find what the URL of the document to validate is, and gives the same error message as when it is
      given a type of URL it does not understand.</p>

      <p>
        Also, requests to non-secure HTTP resources from links in documents
        transferred with a secure protocol such as HTTPS should not include
        referrer information
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec15.html#sec15.1.3">per the HTTP/1.1 specification</a>.
        As the validator at validator.w3.org is currently not available over
        HTTPS, this referrer feature will not work reliably for documents
        transferred over secure protocols (usually <code>https</code> URLs)
        with it.
      </p>

      <p><strong>How to fix</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Check that it is indeed the <code>Referer</code> issue. The validator should have redirected you to
	<code>https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=<em>your_url_here</em></code>. Otherwise, check the address you have given the validator.</li>
	<li>The validator cannot fix this issue. You will have to (ask your administrator to) reconfigure
	whichever zealous software is stripping this referrer info.</li>
	<li>If you have a link on your page using the "/check?uri=referer" feature, you could replace them with the
	a link to the validator without this feature, e.g. <code>https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com</code></li>
	<li>If you have no control over the page or annoying software, or your page's URL is a <code>https</code> one, simply append the address of the page you wanted validated (URI encoded)
	to the <code>https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=</code> address.</li>
