# W3C Automotive Working Group

This is the repository for the specifications created by the [Automotive Working Group](http://www.w3.org/auto/wg/).

> The mission of the Automotive Working Group is to develop Open Web Platform specifications for HTML5/JavaScript application developers enabling Web connectivity through in-vehicle infotainment systems and vehicle data access protocols. The API is agnostic with regard to the connection used.

The specifications in this repository are as follows:
- [Vehicle Information Service Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vehicle-information-service/) (git)
- [Vehicle Information Service Specification version 2 - CORE](https://raw.githack.com/w3c/automotive/gh-pages/spec/VISSv2_Core.html) (git)
- [Vehicle Information Service Specification version 2 - TRANSPORT](https://raw.githack.com/w3c/automotive/gh-pages/spec/VISSv2_Transport.html) (git)

## Repository Layout

- /media_tuner/ - deliverables from the Media Tuner Task Force
- /vehicle_data/ - working copies of the vehicle and information API specifications 

## Tools

- [ReSpec](https://www.w3.org/respec/) has been used to style the specifications allowing the editors to focus on functionality and ensure consistency and referential integrity
- The [API Design Cookbook](http://www.w3.org/TR/api-design/) has been used as a guide for the use of WebIDL

## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Style Guidelines

JavaScript should be written using the [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) rule set defined by [Echidna](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/blob/master/.jscs.json).
