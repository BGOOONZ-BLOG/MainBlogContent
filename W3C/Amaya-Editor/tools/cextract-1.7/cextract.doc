NAME
     cextract, cextdoc - C prototype/documentation extractor

SYNOPSIS
     cextract [ -Q# ] [ +AaPpNnxZ ] [ -o ofile ] [  -Hstr  -Yprog
     -B -b -V -v ] [[ -options ] filename... ]

     cextdoc [ -Q# ] [ +AaNnx ] [ -o outfile ] [ -Yprogram -B  -b
     -V -v ] [[ -options ] filename... ]

DESCRIPTION
     The  cextract  program  is  used  to  extract  the  function
     descriptions  (aka prototypes) from a list of C source files
     and send them out to the  standard  output  or  a  specified
     file.   It  may also be used to generate basic documentation
     for a list of C source files.

     The specific reason this program was written was to  provide
     a  method of automatically generating header files, contain-
     ing prototypes, for all of the functions used  throughout  a
     multi-file project.

     Along with the standard C preprocessing options, -D, -I, and
     -U,  there are options which allow more control of what form
     the output will take.

     To allow for conditional processing, cextract  automatically
     predefines  the  __CEXTRACT__ identifier.  Preprocessor com-
     mands, such as "#if", "#ifdef" and  "#ifndef"  may  then  be
     used  to  control  what  code is parsed by cextract.  If the
     cextdoc command  is  used,  the  program  will  also  define
     __CEXTDOC__.

     The cextract program also supports the use of  customization
     files.   A  system configuration file will be read, and then
     any ".cextrc" file in the user's home directory, and finally
     any ".cextrc" file in the current directory.  For a descrip-
     tion of the  format  of  the  customization  file,  see  the
     cextrc(5) manual page.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     The cextract and cextdoc  programs  support  both  long  and
     short  command  line  options.   Also,  a `+' sign before an
     option description means that it can be either  on  or  off,
     with a `+' prefix enabling that option or a `-' prefix disa-
     bling it.  The prefix of "no-" (or "no") is  also  supported
     for disabling an option.

     Most command line arguments may be used anywhere on the com-
     mand  line,  but  a few must be used before any file parsing
     begins [such as the -N, +Z and -x options], and one can only
     be the first argument on the command line [the -Q flag].

     +A, +sort-all
          Sort the output, listing all functions in  alphabetical
          order.  This option is not compatible with the +C flag,
          since functions are sorted over  the  entire  spectrum,
          not just for each file.

     +a, +sort-by-files
          Sort the output, listing functions  alphabetically  for
          each   file.    Since   this  option  sorts  each  file
          separately, it is compatible with the +C  flag,  unlike
          the  +A option.  For cextract, the default is to not do
          any sorting, while the cextdoc default is  to  sort  by
          files.

     -b, -build-config
          Automatically build a configuration file in the current
          directory based on the current program settings.

     -B, -system-build
          Generate a system wide configuration file based on  the
          current program settings.

     +C, +first-comments
          Capture the first comment encountered in each file  and
          include it in the generated output. [default off]

     +c, +comments, +yank-comments
          Take the comment  immediately  preceding  the  function
          declaration  and send it as output along with the func-
          tion prototype. [default on]

     -Dexpression, -define=expression
          Define a macro, as per  the  C  "#define"  preprocessor
          statement.

     +E, +externs
          Place the string 'extern' before each  function  proto-
          type. [default on]

     +F, +filename
          Prepend the name of the file  to  the  initial  comment
          when  it  is  processed.   This  flag  requires  the +C
          option. [default off]

     -f%##, -font-%-##
          Specify what fonts are to be used when generating troff
          documentation  output.   The  font name is a one or two
          character troff name which will be interpreted later by
          the  troff  processor.  Four fonts are used: `1' or `t'
          which is used only for the title words "Function:"  and
          "File:"  [default  value  of  "C", Courier]; `2' or `c'
          which is used for  comments  [default  value  of  "CO",

          Courier  Oblique];  `3'  or  `n'  which is used for the
          function name [default value of "B", Times  Bold];  and
          `4'  or  `p'  for  the parameter list [default value of
          "R", Times Roman].  Note that the `%'  character  indi-
          cates  the  type being adjusted, and "##" indicates the
          one or two character font name.

     -Hstring, -header-string=string
          During the normal extraction mode, enclose  the  output
          within the sequence "#ifndef string", "#define string",
          ..., "#endif /* string */".  This method is  used  with
          many  system  header files and prevents the header file
          from being parsed more than once.  If  this  option  is
          not used, the output will be enclosed within a "#ifndef
          __CEXTRACT__", "#endif  /*  __CEXTRACT__  */"  sequence
          instead.

     -Idirectory, -include=directory
          Add the indicated directory  to  the  search  path  for
          include  files accessed via the "#include" preprocessor
          statement.  This flag is passed on to the C  preproces-
          sor.

     +m, +multi-comments, +multiple-comments
          If the -c flag is set, look for a "block"  of  multiple
          comments,  instead  of a single comment.  Comments with
          more  than  one  newline  in  between  are   considered
          separate. [default off]

     -N, -roff-mode, -troff-mode
          Enable documentation mode, sending output as -ms  troff
          format.

     -n, -doc-mode
          Enable documentation mode,  sending  output  as  normal
          text.  This is the default mode of the cextdoc program.

     -o outfile, -output-file outfile, -output-file=outfile
          Send output to the specified file instead of the  stan-
          dard output.  The file name need not immediately follow
          the `-o' flag, but it  must  be  the  first  non-option
          argument.  Warning:  This  will  overwrite any existing
          file of the same name.

     +P, +dual-output
          In extraction mode, generate both styles  of  C  proto-
          types,  separated  by using "#ifdef" and "#else" state-
          ments to test for __STDC__.  This option  must  precede
          any file arguments. [default on]

     +p, +ansi-code
          Produce output in ANSI C prototype  format;  otherwise,

          produce  old-style declarations.  This option must pre-
          cede any file arguments.  [default off]

     -qfile, -config-file=file
          Read in the specified file and parse it for  customiza-
          tion commands.

     -Q#, -read-config=#
          An octal  digit  specifies  which  configuration  files
          should  be read; 1 for the system configuration file, 2
          for the $HOME/.cextrc file and 4 for the ".cextrc" file
          in  the current directory.  Add values to read multiple
          files.  If no number is  specified,  a  0  is  assumed.
          This option must be the very first argument on the com-
          mand line.  [default value of 7 reads all three files]

     +r, +remove-names, +discard-names
          Strip out the variable names when sending out the  pro-
          totype lists.

     +S, +show-all, +show-anyway
          If the -p flag is off, output the prototype  list  any-
          way,  but  enclosed  within comments. If the -P flag is
          set, comments and commented prototypes should  also  be
          duplicated  within  the non-ANSI portion of the output.
          [default on]

     +s, +s:none|all|only, +statics, +statics: none|all|only
          Indicate how static functions are to  be  treated.   If
          "none"  is chosen, static functions will be ignored, if
          "only" then any non-static functions will  be  ignored,
          and   "any"   indicates  that  all  functions  will  be
          included.  If no selection is given, either "any"  (`+'
          flag),  or "none" (`-' flag) will be used.

     -T#, -tab-width=#
          Specify the tab width used during documentation output.
          If no value is given, or a value of zero is given, tabs
          are passed though unformatted.

     -Uname, -undefine=name
          Undefine a macro.  If "-Dname" was specified in a  pre-
          vious  argument,  it is removed from the argument list;
          otherwise, this option is passed on to the C preproces-
          sor.

     -V, -settings
          Show  the  current  settings  of  the  various  program
          options.

     -v, -version-info
          Display the version number of the program.

     +W, +break-after-types, +break-types
          When enabled, a newline will be  inserted  between  the
          function  type  and  the  function name in the function
          declarations.

     +w#, +wrap-parameters=#
          If the length of the  parameter  list  for  a  function
          would  cause it to exceed a given number of columns [72
          by default], a newline will be inserted in place  of  a
          space  character,  so that the function will not exceed
          that given length.  The optional number after the  com-
          mand will override a negation prefix if encountered.

     -x, -extract-mode
          Run cextract or cextdoc as a prototype extractor.  This
          is the default mode for cextract.

     -Yprogram -cpp-program=program
          Specify which program to use  as  the  C  preprocessor.
          This  program  should  resolve all of the C defines and
          preprocessor statements while, hopefully, leaving  com-
          ments intact.

     +Z, -merge-output
          Combine the ANSI and K&R C output of  the  cextract  on
          one line, to create a much more compact header file.

VMS
     Configuration files  are  also  supported  under  VMS.   The
     default    configuration   files   for   VMS   systems   are
     sys$library:cext.cnf, sys$login:cext.cnf, and cext.cnf.

     Since the VMS C compiler strips out comments, the documenta-
     tion  mode  and  comment options are not very useful.  Using
     the GNU C preprocessor instead might be a possible solution.

COPYRIGHT
     The code is freely distributable and there are  no  restric-
     tions  other  than the fact that it not be used for monetary
     gain and that copyright notices must be kept intact.

     Both  cextract  and  cextdoc  may  be   used   to   generate
     proprietary source code or documentation, but its own source
     code may not be used as a part of any proprietary programs.

     The header files and documentation generated by cextract and
     cextdoc  are  not  subject  to this COPYRIGHT notice because
     they are derived from the source code which was read  in  by
     the program to create the output.

     special thanks to comp.sources.reviewed reviewers, without whom this
     program would be much less useful.

VMS
     On VMS systems, only the longer  command  line  options  are
     available,  and the '/' character is used to specify command
     line options.

BUGS
     1) As far as I know, there is no way to tell the normal  VMS
     C compiler not to strip out comments.  This renders the com-
     ment extraction and documentation mode portions rather  use-
     less  to VMS sites.  Getting the GNU C preprocessor for such
     sites is recommended.

     2) Cextract has problems with function pointers  and  struc-
     ture  definitions  within the parameter list, using typedefs
     for such declarations is recommended.

     3) Does not yet fully support C++ code.

     4) It is dependent on the given C preprocessor, so will have
     any  limitations  (such  as  maximum  #defines)  which the C
     preprocessor has.

     If any other bugs are detected, please notify the author.
