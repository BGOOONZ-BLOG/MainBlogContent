This document is a prioritized list of Web payments use cases.
Guided by these use cases, the W3C Web Payments Interest Group
plans to derive architecture and associated technology
requirements to integrate payments into the Open Web
Platform. That work will form the basis of conversations with W3C
groups and the broader payments industry about what standards
(from W3C or other organizations) will be necessary to fulfill the
use cases and make payments over the Web easier and more secure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>
    <p>
This document is a work in progress and is being released early and often
using an agile process; it is incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
The Web Payments IG has only had the opportunity to review a handful of the
40+ use cases, 120+ requirements, hundreds of pages of
payments research submitted to the group via various other standards group
output such as ISO20022, research documents from X9 and the US Federal Reserve,
documents from the Web Payments Community Group, and input from the
general public. Our desire is to align with the larger payments industry
when it's possible to do so. Expect this document to be rapidly iterated upon
with that desire in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
The following changes have been made since the last version of this document:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
Reorganization of use cases by phases approved by the Web Payments IG.
      </li>
      <li>
Removal of the "Goals" for each use case as they were repetitive and did not
greatly aid understanding of the use case.
      </li>
      <li>
Addition of Regulatory concerns to a number of the use cases.
      </li>
      <li>
Addition of two more scenarios related to Direct Debit and Credit Transfer.
      </li>
      <li>
Addition of "Relationship to Other Documents" section.
      </li>
      <li>
Integration of a unified Web Payments Activity glossary.
      </li>
      <li>
Addition of Escrow, Biometric, Know Your Customer (KYC), and
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) use cases.
      </li>
      <li>
Integration of feedback from the public, Web Payments Community Group, and
Web Payments Interest Group.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
ECommerce is thriving and continues to expand. However,
fragmentation of payment systems is limiting the growth potential
as are problems &mdash; both real and perceived &mdash; such as
fraud and usability.
    </p>

    <p>
Because the Web is ubiquitous, strengthening support for Web
payments has the potential to create new opportunities for
businesses and customers. Mobile devices are already transforming
the industry by supplanting physical payment cards in proximity
payments, voucher distribution, and identification when people
authenticate to a scanner, point of sale, or access gate. Although
we are seeing innovation in mobile payment systems, the lack of
standards makes it more difficult to adapt to new payment
approaches or integrate new payment providers.
    </p>

    <p>
The W3C Web Payments Interest Group is developing a roadmap for standards to
improve the interoperability of payments using Web technologies for both
online and brick-and-mortar (offline) scenarios. This will help achieve
greater interoperability among merchants and their customers,
payment providers, software vendors, mobile operators, native mobile
apps, and payment networks. The roadmap will include
<a title="payment scheme">payment schemes</a> in use
today (such as electronic checks, credit cards, direct debit, and
cryptocurrencies) and those of the future. The roadmap will be derived from
the use cases listed below.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Why This Work is Important</h3>
      <p>
The Web Payments work is not just about making payments easier, faster,
more secure, and more innovative. There are many people around the world that
today's financial system does not reach. These people are called the world's
unbanked (or underbanked). The unbanked often live paycheck to paycheck, do
not have access to savings accounts or low-fee check cashing services, lines
of credit, or a way of saving for their future. Being unable to plan for one's
financial future often results in a focus on the short-term, which creates a
vicious cycle of not being able to escape one's situation. Not being able to
participate in the financial system creates unintended inequities that create
waste and result in a net loss for society.
      </p>
      <p>
However, some of the shortcomings of today's financial system could be
addressed via technological improvements. For example, there is a considerable
overlap between the unbanked and underbanked population and access to advanced
mobile phones and the Web. By providing financial services to people with
mobile phones in a standardized way via the Web, we could see an improvement
in the financial health of these individuals and their families.
      </p>
      <p>
Extending the current financial system to reach further helps an ever
increasing number of people plan for their future, focus on the long-term, and
thus contributes to a greater net gain for society.

      <p>
Each use case has:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
A title and short description.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
A short <em>Motivation</em> statement to help explain why the use
case has been included, including how it relates to similar use cases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Each use case may also have notes on:
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
Security/Privacy. Security or privacy issues that may arise through this use
case.
        </li>
        <li>
Accessibility. Accessibility considerations (e.g., in multi-factor
authentication, management of biometrics in the case of users with some
disabilities).
        </li>
        <li>
Regulatory. Regulatory considerations (e.g., anti-money laundering
clearing, suspicious activity reporting, tax collection, trade compliance).
        </li>
        <li>
Exceptions. Considerations in the case of specific exceptions (e.g., if a
user pays with a voucher and the <a>transaction</a> fails, the user's voucher
should be restored).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="issue">
The group seeks input from security, privacy, and accessibility experts.
Examples of desired groups to perform these reviews are, but are not
limited to: W3C Privacy Interest Group,
W3C Security Interest Group, W3C Web Accessibility Initiative and
Protocols and Formats Working Group, US Federal Reserve Security Panels,
X9 Security subgroups, and ISO security subgroups.

    <h2>An Overview of the Payment Phases</h2>

    <p>There are many types of <a>transaction</a>s in the world of payments,
including person-to-business, business-to-business, business-to-person,
government-to-person, person-to-government, and
person-to-person. In this document we focus on the
interactions between a <a>payer</a> and a <a>payee</a>,
either of which could be a person, business, government, or software
agent), which we organize into four phases:</p>

    <p class="issue">
The group would like feedback related to the general structure of the payment
phases from individuals that worked on ISO20022, ISO12812, the
European Payment Commission, and
various X9 documents to ensure that the phases reflect business processes
outlined in financial standardization initiatives. Feedback from the general
public is also requested to see if non-payment professionals can navigate and
understand the document without prior payment industry knowledge.

        </li>
    </ol>

<p>The descriptions below only discuss the interactions between the
<a>payer</a> and the <a>payee</a>. We do not expose the low-level exchanges
between banks, card associations, or other back-end "payment clearing" parties
in a <a>transaction</a>. Those details will be discussed in the Interest
Group's work on architecture and
requirements.</p>

 <p>Each phase below consists of a series of steps.
The details of each step vary by <a>payment scheme</a>. Some steps may
not be relevant at certain times (e.g., depending on
<a>payment scheme</a> or <a>transaction</a> specifics).
For example, some  <a title="purchase">purchases</a> do not involve a proof of
funds or proof of hold. ACH and SEPA
<a title="payment scheme">payment schemes</a> generally do not support the
verification of available funds, thus in these
<a title="payment scheme">payment schemes</a> the particular proof of funds
step is skipped.
In some cases, steps may happen in a slightly different order than described below.
  </p>
    <p>
It is also important to note that these phases and steps may be interrupted
at various times (e.g., one party drops out, or exceptions occur like
insufficient funds or a regulatory block). While these phases are an
approximation of the general flow of all payments, they are helpful in
structuring the use cases such that it is easy to figure out to which part of
the payment process a particular use case belongs.
    </p>

 <p>While these four phases may apply more or less well to a variety
of other payment scenarios such as person-to-person
payments, those topics are not the current focus of the group.  We
plan to address them directly in <a href="#future-work">future
work</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Terms</h3>
      <p>
In the first phase of the payment process, the <a>payer</a> and the
<a>payee</a> negotiate the terms of the payment.
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>. The <a>payer</a> discovers the
<a title="payee">payee's</a> offer (e.g., by browsing a Web page or
from a native application).
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>. The <a>payer</a> and the
<a>payee</a> agree to what will be purchased, for how much,
in what currency, which <a title="payment scheme">payment schemes</a>
or loyalty programs are acceptable, etc. The <a>payee</a> may require the
<a>payer</a> to authenticate themselves. The <a>payee</a> may generate an
invoice for the <a>payer</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>. The <a>payer</a>
discovers and applies any loyalty programs, coupons, and other special offers
to the payment terms.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</h3>
      <p>
In the second phase of the payment process, <a>payer</a> and
<a>payee</a> determine which
<a title="payment instrument">payment instruments</a> the
<a>payer</a> will use to transfer funds to the <a>payee</a>.
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Discovery of Accepted Schemes</strong>. The <a>payer</a>
discovers the <a title="payment instrument">payment instruments</a> that
are accepted by the <a>payee</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Selection of Payment Instruments</strong>. The <a>payer</a>
selects one or more <a title="payment instrument">payment instruments</a>
that are available to the <a>payer</a> and are accepted by the
<a>payee</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Authentication to Access Instruments</strong>. The
<a title="payer">payer's</a> access to the <a>payment instrument</a>
is authenticated. The <a>payer</a> consents to pay. Note: This authentication
with the <a>payment processor</a> is distinct from any authentication required
by the <a>payee</a> (such as when a merchant requires a customer to
have an account and log in to the merchant's Web site).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
      <p>
The third phase of the payment process is used to initiate the transfer of
funds. Depending on the <a>payment instrument</a>, the transfer of funds
may be verified immediately or only after several days.
      </p>
       <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Initiation of Processing</strong>. Depending on the
<a>payment instrument</a>, the <a>payer</a> (e.g., when using
PayPal or Yandex Money), the <a>payee</a> (e.g., when using a credit card), or other
party (e.g., bank) initiates processing.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Verification of Available Funds</strong>. The <a>payer</a> may
need to provide a proof of funds or a proof of hold to the <a>payee</a>
before finalizing payment and delivery of the product.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Authorization of Transfer</strong>. The <a>payee</a> receives
proof that the transfer of funds has been authorized.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Completion of Transfer</strong>. The <a>payment scheme</a>
determines the details of payment clearing and settlement. Transfer times
may vary from near-realtime to multiple days. The <a>payee</a>,
the <a>payer</a>, and/or third parties (such as regulatory bodies) may be
notified as each stage of the clearing and settlement process is completed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Delivery of Product/Receipt and Refunds</h3>
      <p>
In the fourth phase of the payment process, the <a>transaction</a> is completed
by providing the <a>payer</a> with a receipt and/or the product that
was purchased.
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Delivery of Product</strong>. The <a>payer</a> receives goods or
services immediately, at a later date, automatically on a recurring basis,
etc. depending on the terms of the <a>purchase</a>. A digital proof of
payment may be required to access the product.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Delivery of Receipt</strong>. Depending on the
<a title="payment scheme">payment scheme(s)</a> chosen, there are
various ways and times that a receipt may be delivered (e.g., credit card
receipt, digital proof of <a>purchase</a>, or encrypted line-item receipt).
        </li>
        <li>

    <h2 id="phases-overview">A Simple Example of the Payment Phases</h2>
    <p>
The following scenario is provided to aid the reader in understanding how the
phases of the payment process apply to a real world situation. In this scenario,
we follow Jill, who seeks a new outfit for a party. She selects items from
PayToParty, which is a brick-and-mortar store with an online presence.
She chooses how to pay and the items are delivered to her home on the
following day.
    </p>

    <p>
See the appendix for <a href="#additional-examples">additional examples of
the payment phases</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
General feedback is requested on whether this section is helpful. We are
attempting to ground the payment phases and steps in a real world use case.
An alternative would be removing this section entirely if the preceding
section suffices, or moving this narrative to section 7 with the other examples.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Purchase Terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>: Jill begins her <a>purchase</a> at
home on her laptop, where she browses the items on the PayToParty Web
site. On the way to work the next morning, she explores the catalog
further from a native app on her smart phone. Jill can't decide
whether the dress displayed online is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_(viral_phenomenon)">
blue with black stripes or white with gold stripes</a>,
so during her lunch break, she drops into the
PayToParty store near her office. She spots a few more items that
she thinks she'd like to <a>purchase</a>, but decides to wait until later to
make the <a>purchase</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>: That same evening at home,
Jill logs into her account on the PayToParty Web site, adding her
chosen items to her shopping cart. The total price appears on the
page.
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>: As Jill prepares to
check out, PayToParty notifies her of a discount for 10% if she uses
the store's loyalty card to pay.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Discovery of Accepted Schemes</strong>: Given where Jill lives,
PayToParty accepts payment by credit card, debit card, the PayToParty
loyalty card, and PayPal, but not Jill's favorite cryptocurrency (which she
uses on other sites).
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Selection of Payment Instruments</strong>: Jill pushes the
"Pay Now to Party!" button and is presented with a number of options
to pay, including her
credit card, her PayToParty loyalty card (which is highlighted to remind her
of the discount), and a PayPal account. There is also a gift card from
PayToParty that she received for her birthday, but she chooses not to
use it for this <a>purchase</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Authentication to Access Instruments</strong>: Jill selects
the PayToParty loyalty card, the use of which is protected by two-factor
authentication, and is asked to input a code that is sent to her phone
before the <a>purchase</a> can be completed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Initiation of Processing</strong>. PayToParty receives a
message from Jill's device authorizing the payment. PayToParty
submits the message to their <a>payment processor</a>, requesting a
proof of hold for the funds.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Verification of Available Funds</strong>. PayToParty
receives a proof of hold on Jill's funds for the <a>purchase</a> price of
the goods. The PayToParty night-shift employees begin packing her purchased
items for delivery the next day.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Authorization of Transfer</strong>. Once Jill's package is ready to
go, PayToParty exchanges the proof of hold for a proof of payment by
re-submitting the request to the payment network. They receive a proof of
payment from the <a>payment processor</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Completion of Transfer</strong>. Since Jill's PayToParty loyalty card
operates as a credit card, PayToParty will receive the funds in their normal
end of week settlement.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Delivery of Product/Receipt and Refunds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Delivery of Receipt</strong>. Jill's cloud-based wallet
receives a detailed line-item digital receipt for the <a>purchase</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Delivery of Product</strong>. Jill's package goes out by courier the
next morning and is on her doorstep before she leaves for work.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>

    <p>
The use cases below rely on a number of assumptions that are not
detailed in the use cases but that will be explored in more detail in
the architecture and requirements documents.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Connectivity</strong>. Connectivity requirements vary according to
use case. The types of connections a device may use include Internet
connectivity, proxied connections through short-range radio transmissions,
and proximity connections over a technology such as Near-Field Communication
(NFC) or Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE). Some use cases assume no
connectivity (e.g., user is temporarily unable to connect to a mobile phone
network or a WiFi hotspot).
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Registered Payment Instruments</strong>. In order for the
<a>payer</a> to select and utilize
<a title="payment instrument">payment instruments</a>, they must be
registered in some way and discoverable by a browser, native application,
or other software.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Security</strong>. Keys, encryption, and other security technology
must be used to secure sensitive information. It is important that sensitive
information is not transmitted to parties that do not absolutely need to
know the information in order to complete the <a>transaction</a>.</li>
        <li>
<strong>Identity</strong>. There will be an interoperable
identifier used to identify the participants and accounts in a Web Payments
transaction.
        </li>
    </ul>

          <dd>
At present kiosks are rarely accessible to blind people, people with low
vision, people who use wheelchairs, or people with restricted mobility that
makes touch interaction difficult or impossible. They don’t tend to offer
speech output, any ability to zoom or customise colours, may be difficult to
reach from a wheelchair/sitting position, and do not accept voice commands.
Enabling as much of the payment interaction to move to a customer-held device
with accessibility features would help alleviate a number of barriers that
exist today.

Cory should exercise control over how much he wants the merchant
to be able to track his activities. Programs like loyalty cards will
likely involve agreement to more data with the merchant.<br/>
Making kiosks that are used for financial transactions accessible introduces
several challenges. Speech output may be overheard by people nearby, increased
text size and/or visibility of content may make it easier for other people
to read, and voice commands may also be overheard.

One of the biggest security flaws of <a>payee</a>-initiated payments is that
all the information necessary to initiate a <a>transaction</a> from the
<a title="payer">payer's</a> financial account is typically transmitted
to the <a>payee</a>. For example, credit card information along with
expiration date, name, and CVV2 code are transmitted and could be intercepted
by rogue software running on the <a title="payer">payer's</a> servers.
Special attention should be paid to ensuring that this risky security
model isn't supported by a Web Payments solution. For example, at a minimum,
credit card tokenization such as EMVCo's solution should be supported
alongside other tokenization solutions.
