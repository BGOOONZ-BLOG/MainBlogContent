## package metadata ##

Markus: quick recap of the issue and solution options

As per thread, we have 3 options:

A and B involve using RDFa 1.1 or 1.0 respectively

C says that we define our own meta element instead of building on RDFa

C like epub 2 uses all dc: metadata names as per http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines/

(instead of dcterms, where some terms are problematic in that they cannot have a string value)

also as per last call, allowing meta @name/@content in option C for backward compatibility with 2x reading systems

Our problem is primarily one of time. RDFa 1.1 Core 3-4 months away, probably longer, EPUB is 1 month away.

Murata: what was the recommendation of Manu Sporny (chair of the W3C RDFa working group)?

Markus: he advised us to not move too swiftly based on recent W3C events, but wait and observe the taskforce work. He was not aware of our timeline.

Bill Kasdorf:  What is the viability of our spec as the HTML5 spec evolves? We don't want to make our spec awkward or obsolete in the future.  Is it more disruptive in the future to wish we had attributes like @about, or to use such terms now and perhaps falsely assert a connection with RDF?

Murata/Markus: it could result in a broken graph if people falsely interpret our metadata as RDFa. We've already seen this happen with the current solution. The alternative is to use other names and publish a dedicated algorithm for generating an RDF graph form the dc: elements and the meta elements, for metadata harvesters etc that need RDF representation

[danhughes](danhughes.md) grddl: http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec

Markus/BillK: We maintain the ambition to align with W3C metadata frameworks in future EPUB revisions. This is primarily a timeline issue.

Dan Hughes: +1 for option C; important to keep some distance between us and RDFa 1.1.  In the future, we can create a mapping from our approach to RDF graphs.

Another point in favor of option C: fixing our current graph problems would increase syntax complexity

[EricFreese](EricFreese.md) this discussion does not modify epub:switch, correct? (ed: no impact on epub:switch)

Are we all agreed on option C?  No objections.

Next steps: create a blueprint of changes that would be required, followed by WG review of details, followed by spec integration

Murata: will our syntax look like RDFa?

Markus: This proposal is, primarily to avoid collisions in a future migration, to use names that are locally defined, perhaps following naming convention suggestions in http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines/ , for example @refines and @xsi:type

However, we intend to keep meta and link elements.

Murata: there is confusion surrounding these names

[danhughes](danhughes.md) +1 @refines

Markus: The naming issue will be explored further in the next steps.






## fixed layout ##

Upcoming workshop in Taiwan.  Will try to arrange for remote connectivity

Garth: is a half day enough?

Others agree; going to consider people's schedules etc.

Markus: is fixed layout scope creep in EPUB 3? Workshop can explore use cases.

Potential to address fixed layout post EPUB 3.0

Murata: would like to incorporate these features as a subset/profile or standardize in 3.1.

Two issues, #155 and #156 could threaten subsetting

Casey describes things that Apple did to do fixed layout: respect absolute positioning; viewport defines dimensions of the book.  However, they cannot release the documentation at this time.

Peter: we want to have this workshop in Taiwan (in October).  I'd like to have the documents that are associated with the proposals in order to review ahead of time.

Markus: do we want to do anything to prepare for possible future profiles?

Murata: let's wait until after the workshop

Decision: defer issues #155 and #156





## CFI ##

Garth: [Issue #133](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=#133) can be resolved by EPUB CFI

Garth: [Issue #149](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=#149) Murata made some spec verbage suggestions; could probably assign to Matt

Garth: [Issue #152](https://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/detail?id=#152) still bubbling on the list

More feedback required

Easy way to solve it: fix example for interpublication links

All agree that this issue can be closed today with an easy fix.

[garth](garth.md) Garth: #152 to be closed with altering intra-publication example to be "<a href='../pub.opf#epubcfi(/6/4[chap01ref]!/4[body01]/10[para05]/2/1:3[;s=b])'>location</a>"

[garth](garth.md) So, bubbling should not now.  :-)

[garth](garth.md) s/not/stop/

ACTION: Matt to make these edits and publish for review

Reminder that the public review period ends Aug 24th

There is a chance that we won't have a call next week, depending on the metadata first step progress. Markus will notify group.
