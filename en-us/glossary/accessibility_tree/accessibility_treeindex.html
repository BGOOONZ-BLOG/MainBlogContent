<p>The <strong>accessibility tree</strong> contains {{Glossary(“accessibility”)}}-related information for most HTML elements.</p>
<p>Browsers convert markup into an internal representation called the <em><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/How_to_create_a_DOM_tree">DOM tree</a></em>. The DOM tree contains objects representing all the markup’s elements, attributes, and text nodes. Browsers then create an accessibility tree based on the DOM tree, which is used by platform-specific Accessibility APIs to provide a representation that can be understood by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</p>
<p>There are four things in an accessibility tree object:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong>
<ul>
<li>: How can we refer to this thing? For instance, a link with the text “Read more” will have “Read more” as its name (find more on how names are computed in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/">Accessible Name and Description Computation spec</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>description</strong>
<ul>
<li>: How do we describe this thing, if we want to provide more description beyond the name? The description of a table could explain what kind of information the table contains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>role</strong>
<ul>
<li>: What kind of thing is it? For example, is it a button, a nav bar, or a list of items?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>state</strong>
<ul>
<li>: Does it have a state? Examples include checked or unchecked for checkboxes, and collapsed or expanded for the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary"><code>&lt;summary&gt;</code></a> element.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the accessibility tree often contains information on what can be done with an element: a link can be <em>followed</em>, a text input can be <em>typed into</em>, etc.</p>
<p>While still in draft form within the Web Incubator Community Group, the <strong><a href="https://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html">Accessibility Object Model</a> (AOM)</strong> intends to incubate APIs that make it easier to express accessibility semantics and potentially allow read access to the computed accessibility tree.</p>
