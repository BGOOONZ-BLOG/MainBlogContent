# Introduction #

Although EPUB3 provides rich features for e-book authoring, authors and implementors are faced with two issues in using EPUB3.

  * Rich features described in rigid specifications make authors and even implementers feel at a loss.  Which feature should be chosen and how should they be combined?
  * EPUB3 allows good design as well as bad design.  For example, it is possible  to create completely non-accessible e-books.  How can we choose good design and avoid bad design?

IDPF can address these issues by creating best practices.

# Potential Risks #

However, best practices have risks:

  * Geographic forks: Best practices for local requirements  (e.g. an “EPUB-J”) may diverge from EPUB3 and global best practices thus preventing global use of EPUB software.
  * Transition from existing documents and software to EPUB  might not be possible without creating non-structured and non-accessible EPUB publications.  Forcible best practices might hamper such transition.

# IDPF Approach for Best Practices (Proposal) #

  * Modularized documentation: Best practices should be described by a collection of documents, each of which covers a particular area only.  Examples of such documents are accessibility best practices, metadata best practices, and East Asian typography best practices.
  * Globalization: Best practices dedicated to a particular natural language should be avoided wherever possible.  Every attempt should be made to find best practices common  to other natural languages.
  * Example-driven: Best practices should be formulated as example documents and accompanying documentation rather than compulsory rules, which may hamper transition to EPUB.
