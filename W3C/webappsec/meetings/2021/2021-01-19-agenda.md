### Draft Agenda

*  A threat model for `crossOriginIsolated`: Artur Janc will walk us through an attempt to clarify the consequences of allowing resources to enter [cross-origin isolated](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#bcg-cross-origin-isolation) contexts, and guide decisions about future platform features that should be gated on cross-origin isolation ([Google doc (with comment access)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JBUaX1xSOZRxBk5bRNZWgnzyJoCQC52TIRokACBSmGc/edit), or [PDF (easier to read)](https://arturjanc.com/coi-threat-model.pdf))

*  Charter: We need one. Dan and Mike will walk us through a draft.
