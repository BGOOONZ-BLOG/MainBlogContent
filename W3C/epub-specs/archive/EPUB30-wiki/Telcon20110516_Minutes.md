Agenda: [Telcon20110516](Telcon20110516.md)

## CFI character escaping ##

`[danielweck`] EPUB CFI ==> http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/linking/cfi/epub-cfi.html#sec-epubcfi-escaping and http://epub-revision.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build/linking/cfi/epub-cfi.html#sec-epubcfi-syntax

Daniel: Completed review of that section, should be good to go

Markus: In the future, we may be able to simplify by referencing IRI.

Markus: We consider the job of solving the character escaping problem to be done


## Scripted Content Documents section ##

Murata-san has been driving the changes in this section.

Markus: Most of the discussion has been about clarifying prose, with exceptions of making the "Security Considerations" and "Event Model Considerations" informative (instead of normative).

Matt: Agree, the changes are clarifications.

Peter: Agreed that it is appropriate for these to be informative.


## Proposed Specification period ##

Activities during this period: collect and address issues, complete schemas, monitor CSS3 updates, update SVG where necessary

Markus: Prose is not frozen; however, we are entering feature freeze mode.  We can collect all input via the issue tracker and review out-of-scope issues in the next revision.

IP review: member orgs to declare essential patent claims to ensure that they won't appear as issues later on.  Incidentally, this makes it important to not add any new features and that any new changes are bug fixes or clarifications, otherwise the timeline will become quite lengthy as additional patent claim reviews will be required.

Markus: Any objections to proceeding to "proposed specification" status?

No one objects.

The board initiates the final notice period when they accept this as a proposed specification. depending on how it's going, the notice period could be extended beyond the minimum 45 days.  or if no additional time is required, then the draft is considered final, at which point it goes to vote

## Near future ##

Congratulations to everyone!

Note that we will not be having weekly concalls anymore; stay tuned to the list for concall announcements, which will hopefully be made a week in advance.
