# activity-streams.js

activity-streams.js is an experimental tool which serves as more of a middle-ware
or short-hand for sending and receiving activity streams objects between two peers.
Objects are registered once and the referenced using their '@id's... So, by that
definition, none of the classes and properties are explicitly implemented at this
layer.

This library is a product of, and used by, the Sockethub project.
