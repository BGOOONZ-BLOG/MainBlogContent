# Web Publications Use Cases and Requirements

This is the repository for the Use Cases and Requirements for the W3C’s specification on Web Publications, developed by the [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/). The editors’ draft of the specification can also be [read directly](https://w3c.github.io/dpub-pwp-ucr/).

## History

A previous version of this document was published by the [Digital Publishing Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG) as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-pwp-ucr-20170502/">Interest Group Note</a>. After the closure of that Interest Group the [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/) took it over for further work. The final version of this document is planned to be published as a Working Group Note.

## Contributing to the Repository
