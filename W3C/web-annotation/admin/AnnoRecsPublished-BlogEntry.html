            <p>The W3C has announced the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6156">publication</a> 
                of three new standards aimed to
                enable an ecosystem of interoperable products that let the world comment on,
                describe, tag, and link any resource on the Web. Many websites already allow
                comments, but current annotation systems rely on unique, usually proprietary
                technologies chosen and provided by publishers. Notes cannot be shared easily across
                the Web and comments about a Web page can only be saved and viewed via a single
                website. Readers cannot select their own tools, choose their own service providers
                or bring their own communities. The adoption of the Web Annotation standards will
                spell the end of the phrase "Don't read the comments!", returning power to the
                readers decide where and how they provide and consume such feedback. </p>
            <h2>What the Web Annotation Standards Do</h2>
            <p>The three new standards describe how to precisely identify the target, body and metadata of
                an annotation of a Web resource. They provide a basic data structure and protocol
                to ensure interoperability among annotation systems, but they do not dictate how
                annotation tools and services are realized in terms of user interface features and
                functionality. Each of the standards serves a specific purpose: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Annotation Data Model</a>
                    provides the structure and details for any web developer to quickly build out
                    compatible tools and content. It gives use cases and examples for the JSON
                    structures to create and consume.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/">Annotation Vocabulary</a>
                    projects the data model into Linked Data, providing a solid and future-proof
                    foundation to enable extension and semantic understanding. In fact, the JSON
                    structures of the Data Model are already semantic as well as easy to implement,
                    via the magic of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a>
                    specification.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/">Annotation Protocol</a>
                    provides a simple RESTful HTTP API for communicating among annotation clients
                    and servers, and builds upon the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked
                        Data Platform</a> specification. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These specifications provide the foundational material for a new generation of
                annotation tools on the Web while still leaving developers free to address specific
                use cases with tailored interfaces and services. This will encourage new innovations
                and the emergence of community-based best practices. For example, The W3C Working
                Group Note on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-html/">Embedding Web
                    Annotations in HTML</a>, published concurrently with the three Web Annotation
                Recommendations, describes and illustrates just a few of the potential approaches
                for including annotations within HTML documents, serving as a
                starting point for further discussion, experimentation and development. </p>
            <h2>Getting This Far and What's Ahead</h2>
            <p>The work on the annotation specifications started in 2009 with two independent
                groups, the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/annotation-ontology/"
                    >Annotation Ontology</a> and the <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/">Open
                    Annotation Collaboration</a> (both of which built upon the early W3C project: <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/">Annotea</a>). In 2011, the two groups
                joined forces to help found the <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/">W3C Open Annotation
                    Community Group</a>. In 2013 this Community Group published a series of <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/#group-reports">initial draft
                    specifications</a>. 2014 saw the creation of the Web Annotation Working Group to
                take the work through the standardization process and further the engagement with
                the web community, resulting in the specifications published on February 23rd, 2017.

            </p>
            <p>As a diverse group of Web developers, publishers, and content creators note below,
                this work is and will be increasingly important as the volume and speed of
                information publishing continue to grow. The world has seen a dramatic increase in
                the spread of misinformation and "fake news", and the web previously lacked a
                decentralized, trustworthy mechanism for fact checking and public discussion. Cory
                Doctorow, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the award-winning <a
                    href="http://boingboing.net/">boingboing.net</a>, describes the importance of
                annotation in this space: </p>
            <blockquote>We are absolutely delighted to see these recommendations land and endorse
                them in full. Though much hard work remains to be done, a formal standard for a
                universal web annotation layer is a critical step in the development of this
                promising new paradigm.</blockquote>
            <p>The broad, growing interest in Web annotation tools and services magnifies the likely impact of
                these specifications. As Dan Whaley, of Hypothes.is and the <a
                    href="https://hypothes.is/annotating-all-knowledge/"> Annotating All
                    Knowledge</a> coalition, notes, the publication of these Recommendations means
                that:</p>
            <blockquote>Annotation has now become a formal part of the Web —-- the importance of
                which cannot be overstated. Over seventy major publishers and platforms under the
                Annotating All Knowledge coalition have pledged to include interoperable annotations
                as a collaborative framework over their content, and these implementations can now
                move forward with confidence. More importantly, browsers can now consider enabling
                users to listen for conversations on every page on the Web as a native capability. </blockquote>
            <p>Another domain that directly benefits from these standards is the
                multi-billion-dollar e-book publishing sector. Sharing annotations from your ePub
                reader — whether on your phone, computer, or dedicated device — and interacting with
                others regardless of their particular platform, enables massive and rapid
                improvements in teaching and learning at all levels. Patrick Johnston, Director of
                Platform Architecture, Product Technology, at the publisher John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. describes the
                importance of the work: </p>
            <blockquote>We've used the Open Annotation Community Group’s Data Model at Wiley for
                some time. The Web Annotation specifications provide some needed improvements and
                additional guidance we're working to implement and look forward to continued
                collaboration around annotation in digital publishing.</blockquote>
            <p>The traditions of scholarly discourse in sharing comments, annotations, etc., is a
                significant use case which can now be brought into the digital age of scholarly
                publishing. The same is true in areas like digital cultural heritage. Sheila Rabun
                is the Community and Communications Officer for the <a href="http://iiif.io/">IIIF
                    Consortium</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework), currently
                consisting of 40 primarily academic and cultural heritage organizations including
                the national libraries of Britain, France, Israel, Norway, and Poland, and
                universities such as Stanford, Harvard, Cornell, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Oxford,
                Cambridge, and Tokyo. She describes the standards' importance in that community:</p>
            <blockquote>The work done in IIIF could not happen without the groundbreaking
                specifications coming from the Open Annotation and Web Annotation groups. Annotation
                is a fundamental part of the IIIF model, and our most asked-for and discussed
                feature in implementations. It increases the visibility of digital cultural heritage
                and enables distributed online scholarship. </blockquote>
