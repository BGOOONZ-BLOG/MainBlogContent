# SNL\_R3.3\_PS1 Hyphenation #

CSS3 [CSS Text Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/) specifies fairly complete line and word breaking.  For CJK text the "line-break" property defines where breaks can occur; for non-CJK text the "word-break" property specifies how words may be broken (including hyphenation).

CSS3 Line Breaking and Word Boundaries seems to meet all requirements of SNL\_R3.3 and should be viable to address the two use cases.

Drafting note: The plan for this, as the target W3C specification is currently at the Candidate Recommendation stage is to normatively reference a non-dated version of the CSS3 Text Level 3 module (these two _specific_ properties _only_), preceded by a normative note that display characteristics generated by use of these properties can not be guaranteed.

Pros:
  1. Standards based (CSS3), in a fairly stable draft (Candidate Recommendation)
  1. Implemented in at least one known EPUB 2.0.1 Reading System
  1. Conforming 2.0 Reading Systems should ignore these properties and render the markup in a simpler fashion

Cons:
  1. Not a final spec
  1. Unknown implementation status (partially in current Safari)
