    <h1>Web Notifications implementation report</h1>
  </header>
<p>This is an implementation report for the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/">Web Notifications</a>
specification.

<p>There is a comprehensive
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/notifications">test suite</a>
for testable requirements in the Web Notifications spec, and the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/test-results/notifications/all.html">complete set of test results</a>
document that there are two independent implementations (in Chrome and/or
Firefox and/or Safari) of all UA requirements in the spec—with the
exception of the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>lack of complete conformance to the WebIDL interface definitions in the spec</li>
<li>a particular corner-case requirement in the spec of handling of invalid
values of <code>lang</code> property, for which the results are
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/test-results/notifications/complete-fails.html">complete failures in all implementing UAs</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding the lack of complete conformance to the WebIDL interface
definitions in the spec, that is not an issue unique to this particular
spec and in fact is a common issue among a number of specs that have
already been published a Recommendations, so the Director has already
determined that particular conformance issue need not prevent any spec from
proceeding to Rec.

<p>Regarding that corner-case requirement in the spec of handling of
invalid values of <code>lang</code> property, the details about that
requirement are as follows:

<p>Step 4 at http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/#dom-notification states a UA
   requirement with regard to the value of the Notification.lang property,
   whose purpose is to convey the language of a notification. That step
   reads, “If options’s <code>lang</code> is a valid BCP 47 language tag,
or the empty string, set notification’s language to options’s
<code>lang</code>, or set it to the empty string otherwise.”
<p>
   Restated, if a Web application tries to set a <code>lang</code> value
   that is not a valid BCP 47 language tag, then according to the spec, the
   UA should set the actual <code>lang</code> property to the empty string.
<p>
   The actual behavior in all UAs is that that if you use a valid BCP 47
   language tag, the UAs behave as you would expect, and set the
   notification’s language value to the BCP 47 language tag you indicated.
<p>
   However, if you use a string that is an <i>invalid</i> BCP 47 language tag,
   no UA follows the spec requirement to set the notification’s language
   value to the empty string.
<p>
   Instead it’s all just basically “garbage in, garbage out”: If you use
   the string “Latn-de”, the UAs will set the notification’s lang value to
   exactly that—without checking whether it’s a valid BCP 47 value.
<p>
   So this isn’t really a problem in the normal case, since if Web
   developers have their Web applications use valid BCP 47 language tags to
   begin with, everything will work as expected. (And if they set a value
   that’s not a valid BCP 47 language tag, things aren’t going to work
   as expected for end users—regardless of what UAs do with it.)

<p>Given that the lang requirement in question emerged originally from
discussions with the Internationalization Core (i18n-core) WG, the lack of
implementation support was
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-core/2015JulSep/thread.html#msg4">discussed with the i18n-core WG</a>
and the resolution of the discussion was essentially that the requirement
could be changed in the next (essentially v2) version of the spec, which is
already in development (and implicitly that UAs which had already
implemented the spec could safely continue to this particular requirement
in the v1 spec, as they are already doing now; and further that since we
don't expect any further implementations of the v1 spec, that no change
to the v1 spec was necessary).</p>

<p>A combined record of tests results for the two conformance cases
described above (the WebIDL conformance issue, and the corner-case
requirement for handling of invalid values of <code>lang</code>
property is
<a
href="https://w3c.github.io/test-results/notifications/less-than-2.html">also available</a>.

<p>Finally, it should be noted that neither Microsoft IE nor Microsoft Edge
implement any support at all for this version of the Web Notifications
spec.
