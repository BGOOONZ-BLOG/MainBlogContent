# Subscriptions / data streams / events

## Goals

* Find a way to implement the concept of Event Interactions

## Next Steps

Start with prototypes motivated by individual use cases

* [Johannes] Source+Sink with RESTHooks
* [Zoltan] BLE-Sink converted to some Source for WoT Things
* [McCool] ROS Protocol to DataSource with WebSockets+JSON
* [Naka-san] Event DataSource with WebSockets+JSON

## How?

* Zoltan and Johannes iterate until there is a common starting point for TD Interaction and Scripting API
* Implementers use common starting point, but can modify it when documenting deltas and reasons
* No random greenfield proposals -- get in contact with Zoltan and Johannes beforehand if really necessary
