# Introduction #

It is considered essential that we have an EPUBCheck for EPUB 3.0, perhaps even as a condition of becoming an approved standard. This page is a stub to track requirements, issues, status, etc.

# Issues #

  * Schema for OPS - HTML5 is not publishing a normative schema; schema for original EPUBCheck was informally created from a James Clark XHTML 1.1 starting point. An OPS schema is now being produced to become a more integral part of the OPS specification; would this be informatively or normatively referenced?
