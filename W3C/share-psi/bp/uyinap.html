          <p>If publication of Open Data is driven only by the external pressures, public administrations might miss the opportunity to seize benefits for themselves. Therefore it is important for public sector bodies to understand their internal needs and priorities regarding their Open Data initiatives and take these needs and priorities into account when selecting datasets for publication.</p>

        <section id="challenge"><h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>How to internalise possible benefits from making data available for re-use?</p>
          <p>Focusing too much on the legal obligations and external pressures to release data for re-use leads to a situation when public sector bodies as data providers often cannot internalise possible benefits from data liberation.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="solution"><h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Governmental bodies thus realise that, besides responding to external pressures, the actual justification for opening data assets is that public bodies could directly reap tangible benefits, resulting in efficiency, effectiveness and hive of public sector innovation. Therefore it is important for public sector bodies to understand their internal needs and priorities regarding their Open Data initiatives and take these needs and priorities into account when selecting datasets for publication.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="why"><h2>Why is this a Best Practice?</h2>
          <p>Needs and priorities of the data owners are no less important than the demand for data. Following this practice should help public sector bodies to reap benefits resulting from making data available for re-use, e.g. reduction of data requests and elimination of unnecessary duplication made possible by the fact that information assets are no more trapped into data silos, economies of scope fuelled by collaborative coding among public agencies and software re-use on top of an accessible common data layer, recourse to collective intelligence for the purpose of solving tough governmental problems through data science.</p>
          <p>Following this practice would contribute to make a further step towards the obtainment of an outcome-based government whose actions demonstrate a clear link with their results generated (i.e., outcomes) in terms of value that, in turn, could be internalised by the governments (e.g., efficiency, effectiveness) without overlooking the quest for the creation of value for society at large ("public value").</p>
