As we wind down 2013, let's reflect on what a great year it's
been for Test the Web Forward. We've held five major events
around the world where attendees contributed thousands of new
testt, added over 1000 new subscribers to our 
mailing list, built up a rich set of centralized W3C test documentation, relaunched testthewebforward.org as the 
one-stop-shop for Open Web Platform testing, and officially became
part of the W3C.  A hearty thanks and congratulations to all of YOU
contributed, attended, participated, and supported our movement. We 
have a truly awesome community.

### Welcome New Subscribers 

 Welcome to our new subscribers who attended our Shenzhen event in 
 November. We had a great time with you all and were once again 
 deeply impressed by the level of enthusiasm we saw in the Chinese
 Web development community.

### Upcoming TestTWF Events

#### Test the Web Forward Seattle, January 26 8:30am-8:00pm PST

 Earlier this year in April, the IE Developer Relations team hosted 
 a great event at the Microsoft office in Seattle. The event was such
 a success, we're going back to kick off TestTWF 2014, once again 
 graciously hosted by Microsoft. If you're in the Pacific Northwest,
 don't miss this one! [Registration is now open][1].

### Past TestTWF Events

#### Test the Web Forward Shenzhen @ TPAC, November 9

 In November, we returned to China for a third time and met hundreds
 more passionate Web developers. Experts came from all over the 
 world to work with the local community and we had a dazzling lineup
 of speakers, including Tim Berners-Lee! It was a full day of
 learning, hacking, food, drinks and prizes.
 
 Read some good summaries of the event here:

* [51CTO][4]

### Test the Web Forward Event Kit - Now Available!

 We're pleased to announce that our [Event][5] and [Meetup][6] Kits
 are now available on testthewebforward.org. As we move into 2014,
 we'll be actively seeking organizations (big or small) and user
 groups to host their own TestTWF events. If you've never hosted an
 event or aren't familiar with Test the Web Forward, we've provided
 these kits with all the details you'll need to get you going. If
 you're interested in hosting an event, you may also send a note to
 public-testtwf-planning@w3.org and we can help get you started.

### CTA: Get Involved!

#### Contribute to TestTheWebForward.org

 The invitation remains open to add your own testing documentation 
 to our site. With the much-improved Github workflow, it's easy to 
 [make contributions][7].

 
Thanks for great year of Testing the Web Forward. Happy Holidays and we'll see you next year!
