<p class='phone'><cite>Jeff:</cite> Good morning.<br />
... thank you Sebastian.<br />
... WoT made progress.<br />
... yesterday was a celebration.<br />
... congratulations.<br />
... today is about doing some hard work.<br />
... to figure out what to do next.<br />
... please take agenda seriously.<br />
... learn from each other.<br />
... what are most important for us to work next.<br />
... and learn what people are doing.<br />
... including liaisons with IoT-oriented organzations.<br />
... thank you.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Matthias:</cite> thank you</p>
<p class='phone'>Matthias explains what WoT has achieved...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Matthias:</cite> there were many IoT
eco-systems.<br />
... unfortunately there were IoT silos.<br />
... could not interoperate even when they used the same
protocols.<br />
... WoT enables applications.<br />
... by simplifying integration.<br />
... there was internet, and applications on top. This is analogy.
WWW did good job to interconnect applications.<br />
... IoT is in similar situation.<br />
... IP is common, but on top IP, IoT eco-systems are
different.<br />
... We wanted to use Web technology.<br />
... we defined building blocks.<br />
... to interconnect silos.<br />
... Web Thing has interaction model with narrow waist model.<br />
... Thing description is the centerpiece.<br />
... scripting api is working note.<br />
... we should gather more experiences.<br />
... security concerns. security and privacy guidance for secure
WoT.<br />
... This is high overview.</p>
<p class='phone'>Lagally talks about WoT architecture...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Lagally:</cite> cloud service can be a
Thing.<br />
... edge can be a Thing. mobile devices can be a Thing.<br />
... Things can be used/exposed,<br />
... Zigbee, etc. many protocols can be used.<br />
... appliances, fridges, lamps. industry devices.<br />
... virtual device can be a Thing.<br />
... as long as it can be described by TD.<br />
... There is Interaction affordances. properties, actions and
events.<br />
... event notifies events.<br />
... Hypermedia control. Can relate things by links.<br />
... forms can describe how to submit requests to Things.<br />
... architecture consists of several building blocks.<br />
... TD contains information model, vocabulary, JSON-LD
representation.<br />
... Binding Templates is for integrating various protocols.<br />
... Scripting API. ECMAScript-based API<br />
... security and privacy guidelines. cross-cutting security
guidelines.</p>
<p class='phone'>Lagally explains what is TD...</p>
<p class='phone'>Lagally explains what is protocol bindings
are...</p>
<p class='phone'>Lagally talks on communcations model between Thing
and Consumer...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Lagally:</cite> TD is the lingua franca.</p>
<p class='phone'>Lagally talks on indirect communications through
intermediary...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Lagally:</cite> typically it is a proxy.
home network has firewall.<br />
... servient in the middle can also aggregate many things.<br />
... architecture itself is flexible.</p>
<p class='phone'>Sebastian introduces Thing Description...</p>
<p class='phone'>Sebastian talk on motivation behind TD...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Sebastian:</cite> automation devices are
often accompanied with paper documentation.<br />
... you have webpage manual.<br />
... and also code-snippets.<br />
... what is the name, URI? Functionality, what kind of data?
Engineers need to know.<br />
... protocols, serialization, security requirements... Engineers
need to know.<br />
... TD should provide those information.<br />
... People start with landing HTML page and can interact with Web
application.<br />
... TD is the same for WoT.<br />
... TD can describe many kinds of devices.<br />
... TD is based on JSON, consistent with JSON-LD.<br />
... TD spec defines very small set of terms.<br />
... title, id, created time, and other metadata.<br />
... TD contains security schemes.<br />
... TD has property, action and events.<br />
... TD has datatype system borrowed from JSON-LD.<br />
... TD provides context extension.<br />
... If you want, you can add additional term definitons such as
iot.schema.org.<br />
... This is a powerful constructs, and allows to use existing
knowledge.<br />
... TD allows use of links.<br />
... This was TD internal.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: addition of context, isn't it
metadata?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Matthias:</cite> whole TD is metadata.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: you can plugin additioal semantics.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Sebastian:</cite> Yes, exactly.<br />
... e.g. industry-specific terms.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> we use extension for protocol
binding as well.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: agreement is necessary for
semantics.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Sebastian:</cite> Yes.</p>
<p class='phone'>Joshue modular accessibility semantics, for
example.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> we should incubate semantic
modules.<br />
... for now core vocabulary is very slim.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Matthias:</cite> bottom-up semantics and
top-level semantics.</p>
<p class='phone'>Sebastian continues on explaining protocol
binding...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Sebastian:</cite> we are open to using other
protocols.<br />
... context extention can play a role here as well for changing
parameters of protocols.<br />
... It was a brief introduction to TD.</p>
<p class='phone'>Zoltan starts introducing Scripting API...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> the work started in IG.<br />
... in Working group, used GitHub to develop working group
Note.<br />
... it is API for node.js. Not really for browser. This is an
issue.<br />
... Web has scripting API. It is easy to use for everyone.<br />
... half of all web develpers develops JavaScript programs.<br />
... webpage, URL, HTML. Thing, URI, WoT Scripts. there are
analogies.</p>
<p class='phone'>Zoltan explains Scripting API's role in
architecture.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> Scripting API is for
describing behaviours.<br />
... scripts can run on cloud, gateway or on devices.</p>
<p class='phone'>Zoltan explains three approaches....</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> no exposed API, simple API
(e.g. Dave Ragget's proposal) and current API.<br />
... current API follows TD specification closely.<br />
... we will discuss more tomorrow.<br />
... I also like simple API as well.<br />
... Ege tried other languages.<br />
... we documented everything.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Jeff:</cite> is it a matter of fashion? plus
and minuses. what is the fasion? how do you decide what is
best?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> we listen to people.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Matthias:</cite> people prefer different
approaches depending on who you ask.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Jeff:</cite> we can describe which community
should use which styles.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Matthias:</cite> some people also say they
do not need scripting API, some others suggest simplification.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> you need to be aware of other
languages.<br />
... time will tell.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Kaz:</cite> possible impact on e.g. NHK
broadcasting company. They used updated scripting.<br />
... we also need to talk with those industry guys.</p>
<p class='phone'>McCool talk on security and provacy
guidelines...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> WoT is descriptive. we are
not defining new security mechanism.<br />
... each document has security and privacy section.<br />
... TD spec has one section as well.<br />
... we created security and provacy guideline document.<br />
... there is also security testing plan document.<br />
... best guideline is evolving.<br />
... we need to constantly update this separate guideline
document.<br />
... TD can describe insecure devices as well.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Kathy:</cite> security is out of band of
TD.<br />
... secure-wiress connection, for example.<br />
... therefore, very confusing.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> We call it security schemes.
TD is about describing how to access a Thing.<br />
... to help developers.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Kathy:</cite> why we need it?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> We had discussion.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Kathy:</cite> security is somewhere
else.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> TD should describe some
information.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Lagally:</cite> we have dedicated security
discussion. FYI.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Matthias:</cite> we aee also following IETF
work.</p>
<p class='phone'>Lagally explains subsequent agendas.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Lagally:</cite> Please observe time.<br />
... we are 37 minutes late.</p>

it was put into sea, how it was harvested.<br />
... nice story about salmon.<br />
... this was just an example.<br />
... There are open source tools.<br />
... next one is EPCIS 2.0 for making track and trace first class
citizen of the Web.<br />
... EPCIS 1.0 exists already.<br />
... 2.0 is moving information system into the Web.<br />
... movement of goods cab be described.<br />

<p class='phone'>Panasonic home IoT: connected, SW defined,
upgradeable.</p>
<p class='phone'>Intend to support already connected devices in WoT
abstract architecture.</p>
<p class='phone'>Using a local/home gateway to support existing
devices.</p>
<p class='phone'>Panasonic presented a demo with a Smart home room,
virtual things (simulator), a WoT client in a browser and a WoT
client on Node-RED.</p>
<p class='phone'>Panasonic exposed APIs based on WoT interaction
model</p>
<p class='phone'>One such application is HomeX which leverage
Panasonic "touchpoints" in the home (all things controllable).</p>
<p class='phone'>Showing a concept video, presenting use cases,
e.g. assisted laundry program, notifying about favorite TV programs
+ switching on TV, multi-room music playback with user presence
sensing, tips about food preparation.</p>
<p class='phone'>Expectations on standardization: align with
existing standards as much as possible, using WoT interaction
model. For APIs we need domain specific vocabularies.</p>
<p class='phone'>Some of them are covered (home appliances), others
are not (audio-visual, outside home, etc).</p>
<p class='phone'>Questions.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question about the own API vs TD + bindings.
Answer: open API and TD are complementing each other.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: the Panasonic API was presented, in
previous presentation a REST API was mentioned; what is the
similarity? Answer: yes, it's a RESTful API.</p>

<h3 id="day1-item05">Abstracting and Interacting with Vehicles in the
Web of Things (BMW)</h3>
<p class='phone'>The demo yesterday was a BMW i3 connected to the
cloud with a WoT connector.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Goals:</cite> abstracting vehicles, semantic
annotaions on parts, interact with the many automotive domains,
etc.</p>
<p class='phone'>Today there are a lot of solutions, fragmentation
is a problem.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Requirements:</cite> be able to deal with
safety, complexity, legacy.</p>
<p class='phone'>Presenting the WoT ontology used.</p>
<p class='phone'>Data model to represent Vehicle Signal
Specification (VSS) by Genivi consortium working together with W3C
Automotive WG.</p>
<p class='phone'>Semantic Sensor Network ontology, SOSA pattern /
to model what is a car signal. For instance SOSA Sensor,
ObservableSignal, ObservableProperty etc.</p>
<p class='phone'>SOSA provides the classes, VSS ontology provides
the signals.</p>
<p class='phone'>A vehicle is a Thing. Signals are Properties.
Actuable signals are Actions. DataSchema uses the domain Units.</p>
<p class='phone'>SOSA does not support events, so WoT Events are
not supported ATM.</p>
<p class='phone'>Event modeling pattern is mapped to Event
Ontology.</p>
<p class='phone'>Presenting demos about TD.</p>
<p class='phone'>Demo architecture: using the vehicle web API
backend, created a TD, exposed as Thing, made simple demo Node-RED
flows.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Example:</cite> when the user moved far
enough from the unlocked vehicle, the lock is activated.</p>
<p class='phone'>Lessons learned: safety-security-privacy adapted
to the vehicle. Complexity needs breaking down into subdomains
(each with separate TDs instead of one huge TD) with separate
security aspects.</p>
<p class='phone'>For instance infotainment, engine, HVAC, etc.</p>
<p class='phone'>Different experts can work on each part.</p>
<p class='phone'>All parts might have their own security
scheme.</p>
<p class='phone'>Questions.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: are there open issues with the security
schemes described in WoT?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Answer:</cite> yes, found that out late, so
you can define different schemes and then use it. But in this case
splitting up the TDs makes more sense.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: TD for each car manufacturer; how do car
manufacturers benefit from doing that?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Answer:</cite> there is no common data model
or API. VSS is one solution. In the end, open specifications would
help. They should agree in a core set of interactions in all
APIs.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: what the level of maturity there is
about the vehicle description (which is proprietary ATM)</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Answer:</cite> it's quite early now, VSS is
about 2 years now, divinding into domains is an old idea, but using
the WoT TD is a relatively new thing.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: BMW, JLR, VW are in the same room here -
encouraging there. Answer: the need is seen in the industry,
pushing for WoT.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: on the main alignment pattern slide,
what was the "mental state". Answer: stress level, mental load
while driving.</p>

<h3 id="day1-item06">a WoT Gateway with device virtualization
(Fujitsu)</h3>
<p class='phone'>Usually applications integrate devices one by one,
each with separate interface. A gateway provides one integrated
interface to applications.</p>
<p class='phone'>A gateway encapsulates complexity and provides
adaptors for each device type.</p>
<p class='phone'>The integrated interface can be done using WoT
interactions.</p>
<p class='phone'>Protocol bindings can be used for the
adaptors.</p>
<p class='phone'>Also, a special adapter can be used by the
protocol bindings.</p>
<p class='phone'>Based on adapters, virtual devices can be created
out of physical devices.</p>
<p class='phone'>It might employ TD conversion, protocol
convertion, device management.</p>
<p class='phone'>All this is part of an Adapter runtime.</p>
<p class='phone'>A tree of gateways could be deployed, where the
root works as directory for devices and adapters</p>
<p class='phone'>A large scal system requires multiple
multi-layered gateways deployment</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Experiment:</cite> 1400 devices connected in
3 fields, a) smart home, b) smart factory, c) smart
agriculture.</p>
<p class='phone'>Application handles all fields, based on cloud
gateway.</p>
<p class='phone'>Toward zero configuration: this integration

<h3 id="day1-item07">Describing Legacy Data in Thing Descriptions
(Fujitsu)</h3>
<p class='phone'>WoT allows a common glue between IoT platforms,
instead of bridging each platform to each other platform.</p>
<p class='phone'>Will concentrate on the data format. JSON and CBOR
are accepted, but what about others?</p>
<p class='phone'>When a Thing is WoT compliant, the client can get
the TD and interact right away.</p>
<p class='phone'>However, with legacy devices, this is not
possible.</p>
<p class='phone'>This is similar experience to web browsers being
the entry point to access served content of various types.</p>
<p class='phone'>Most of available data is in CSV format. TD
supports CSV natively.</p>
<p class='phone'>Proposes native type annotation for CSV</p>
<p class='phone'>The second example is TLV (type-length-value) data
format.</p>
<p class='phone'>TLV, notably ASN.1 is used everywhere. TD should
natively support ASN.1</p>
<p class='phone'>Call for TD being more versatile.</p>
<p class='phone'>Questions.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Thomas:</cite> there is already work on
CSV-JSON conversion. Answer: that is one way to do it.</p>
<p class='phone'>Question: now we use JSON Schema, which is not a
full standard now, we could extend it, so what is the minimal delta
that is needed</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Kathy:</cite> we came across the same
problems and solved with adapters as well.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Ari:</cite> this is a broad problem that is

... Smart Nation covers areas such as Digital identity, E-Payments,
Sensor Platform, Smart Urban Mobility, Moments of Life and so
on<br />
... Elevator changed real estate business. Likewise, autonomous
vehicle changes what city looks like.<br />
... Singapore is tiny, 740 km2<br />
... Sensor Characteristics<br />
... Smart lancos<br />
... You have passive and active sensors.<br />

... IoT Data<br />
... We need standards.<br />
... We can deploy from country perspective.<br />
... We can ask very specific questions.<br />
... WoT brings what can we do with data.<br />
... Platform approach.<br />
... We believe in API economy.<br />
... Privacy is one of concern.<br />
... If you have a passport government has information.<br />
... If you travel the data is collected.<br />
... (video: Robot testing at Takenaka Corp. construction
site)<br />
... How do you keep the data fresh?<br />
... The robot can move to construction site, take photos of
there.<br />
... We also deploy autonomous underwater vehicles.<br />
... ERP2<br />
... Congestion is biggest problem in the city.<br />
... Give car owners smartphone equivalent devices.<br />
... If you are contributing to traffic needs to pay.<br />
... Information is pushed to drivers.<br />
... We also have BUS on demand.<br />
... It's autonomous bus without driver.<br />
... I'll explain Pungol digital district.<br />
... University in a residential area.<br />
... It's already started construction.<br />
... train station connected to the area.<br />
... traffic goes under ground.<br />
... delivery is done by robotics.<br />
... We already have national digital identity.<br />
... We have security based on biometrics.<br />
... Intended to be showcase of smart nation vision.<br />
... Use cases include identify and access management, autonomous,
footfall<br />
... Architecture includes Open Digital Platform.<br />
... We intend to connect every physical things to digital.<br />
... Thing Description can describe such things.<br />
... Certainly standards need to exists.<br />
... Can WoT standards and implementation make iot data more secure
and interoperable?<br />
...</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Lagally:</cite> question: are you working for
simulation model such as digital twin?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Chinn:</cite> yes, building information
model, infrastructure model, using BIM, Geospacial info<br />
... We have smart glass for AR, for representation.<br />
... idea is to model bunch of environment.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Lagally:</cite> is there any plan to apply the
experience other than singapore?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Chinn:</cite> Yes, we are part of ASEAN
Smart city network.<br />
... Encouraging to share use cases.<br />
... Also with Japan, Australia and Thailand.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> How did you wrap all the
requirements?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Chinn:</cite> We are open to anyone for
ideas.<br />
... We prepare multi billion dollar budget.<br />

fund them.<br />
... Sandbox is prepared for them.<br />
... Plan is before 2023.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Jose:</cite> What is related to open source
and open api?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Chinn:</cite> We use lot of open sources and
contribute back.<br />
... Because lot of ideas can be shared.<br />
... We believe API economy drives lot of business.<br />
... Quality of life of citizens changes.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Alan:</cite> Interoperability of data
issue?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Chinn:</cite> yes, it's issue.<br />
... Data is extremely critical and interoperability is
important.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Cathy:</cite> Privacy invocation?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Chinn:</cite> There is a dedicated team who
work for privacy of citizens.<br />
... We give the connectivity between government and citizens.<br />
... There is already connection between government and
citizens.<br />
... Bus on demand rather than bus on schedule.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> Metadata get out of sync.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Chinn:</cite> Disaster recovery
question.<br />

<h3 id="day2-item03">Scripting API for the Web of Things</h3>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> Diving into small
segments.<br />
... Scripting is a routing to Web.<br />
... It describes behavior of a thing and controls thing
interaction.<br />
... If you have a scripting runtime there is security
consideration.<br />
... How do you run those scripts?<br />
... Can there be one of more scripts?<br />
... Can there be more stakeholders in one place?<br />
... I took some of notions regarding security from there and still
applies.<br />
... Alternative to scripting is native implementation.<br />
... You can also have visual rules like Mozilla or flows like
node-red.<br />
... Benefits of scripting APIs.<br />
... It makes Web of Things modular.<br />
... It simplifies application developments.<br />
... Reuse business logic again.<br />
... Opportunity for scripting is in the cloud.<br />
... It can be run in the Web browser client.<br />
... Or sensor or sensor hub in the gateway.\<br />
... One deployment has 60 kilo bytes of codes.<br />
... Security talks.<br />
... The point is when you have a isolated context you can represent
multiple things.<br />
... WoT runtime provides OS functionality through the APIs and it
has security configuration.<br />
... It can be a virtual machine, docker container or javascript
runtime.<br />
... It has functionality load as cript, reload a script and so
on.<br />
... Script execution context.<br />
... There is also Special things in WoT Stack, such as Script
Manager Thing, System Access Things.<br />
... About standardization process<br />
... latest working draft released on 2018/11/29<br />
... Current API uses promises as a callback.<br />
... We have reference implementation Node-WoT.<br />
... Approaches to the Scripting API<br />
... Choice: No externally exposed API, Simple API, Current API
based on TD spec.<br />
... difference between simple and current is interaction name is
explicit.<br />
... one thing simple API cannot do is readmultiple
properties.<br />
... The spec has discovery, expose thing and consume thing.<br />
... Overview of API specification.<br />
... You can introspec things based on thing description<br />
... You have two kinds of observing.<br />
... Obverve property and subscribe event.<br />
... We have an example of ConsumedThing.<br />
... We also have an example of ExposedThing.<br />
... (showing examples)<br />
... We also have discovery API.<br />
... Node-WoT is an implementation.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Ben:</cite> Standalone module for client and

<p class='phone'><cite>Aparna:</cite> IoT schema is an extension of
schema.org<br />
... To enable description of physical things.<br />
... It is a community process for domain experts.<br />
... Normalize device definitions from OCF, oneM2M<br />
... Reuse property and relation types from SSN, SOSA, SAREF,
QUDT.<br />
... Annotate Thing Description for domain specific
vocabulary.<br />
... It is for different IoT Actors.<br />
... Device vendors can use iotschema to describe platforms.<br />
... iotschema Semantic Definitions.<br />
... Capability, Interaction, Data Item<br />
... Feature Of Interest Pattern.<br />
... Conceptual integration with other ontologies.<br />
... Example.<br />
... Capability Door Lock is associated with Thing Door<br />
... How to use?<br />
... Main focus is to annotate Thing Description.<br />
... Thing can be described as capability.<br />
... Interactions are annotated with interaction pattern.<br />
... Data Schema can be annotated.<br />
... At the iotschema.org page you can find example.<br />
... Capability example: TemperatureSensing<br />
... Corresponding interaction pattern is Temperature<br />
... Corresponding Data Schema is TemperatureData<br />
... Thing Description Example.<br />
... This is a TD of Temperature Sensor</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> for clarity "unit" is not a TD
built in vocabrary.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Aparna:</cite> iotschema.org is a domain
  specific for Thing Description.<br/>
... iotschema Node-RED<br />
... you can use multiple semantic configuration nodes.<br />
... Status<br />
... Please provide feedback through GitHub</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Milan:</cite> Question: You should separate
event/action/property from semantics.<br />
... example temperature has minimum and maximum values.<br />
... My suggestion is to separate those two.<br />
... What makes the feature of interest?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Aparna:</cite> It is important to know what
is the feature measured by the sensor.<br />
... capability is temperature itself and FOI is outside
temperature.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Victor:</cite> Now there is overlap b/w TD
ontology and iotschema.<br />
... I see the another term in TD ontology.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>McCool:</cite> We cannot change terms.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Victor:</cite> We should sit together
again.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>??:</cite> What is the process submitting domain specific
schema?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Aparna:</cite> We have an intermediate
schema</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Sebastian:</cite> We need some clear guideline.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>??:</cite> How to process really done how to select from
different ontologies?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Aparna:</cite> We try to normalize it.<br />
... It is done by manually.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Jose:</cite> Challenge is using existing
ontology how to properly annotate TDs.</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Aparna:</cite> Sometime it is difficult. It
is exactly iotschema want to address.<br />

- Andrea Cimmino, María Poveda-Villalón and Raúl García-Castro
(Universidad Politécnica de Madrid)</h3>
<p class='phone'>ontology overview</p>
<p class='phone'>developed ontology for WoT</p>
<p class='phone'>vicinity core, vicinity adapters</p>
<p class='phone'>adapters used to access and translate data</p>
<p class='phone'>store tds in a description repository</p>
<p class='phone'>along with additional metadata and mappings</p>
<p class='phone'>then implemented discovery services</p>
<p class='phone'>discovery uses sparql queries to filter
results</p>
<p class='phone'>some queries don't need to access the data, just
TDs</p>
<p class='phone'>but queries can also access actual data from
payloads</p>
<p class='phone'>if endpoints don't have RDF, can use mappings to
translate into RDF and enter into database</p>
<p class='phone'>vicinity is an EU project, also now working a
project called Delta which is about energy</p>
<p class='phone'>summary, provides discovery and distributed
access</p>
<p class='phone'>also can specify various privacy policies</p>
<p class='phone'>use WoT and WoT-mappings</p>
<p class='phone'>also core and saref</p>
<p class='phone'>interop is not only about describing, also
discovery and access</p>
<p class='phone'>question: approach is that all use same
information and data model?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> yes, but if need to use
several ontologies can use query rewriting</p>
<p class='phone'>question: what about privacy wrt what data can be
seen?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> use access controls to limit
what can be discovered<br />
... run policy at client level<br />
... clients says what things are available to who</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> but clients are not good
enforcement points</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> can also use a centralized
approach</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Zoltan:</cite> so have to distribute
policies as well as data?</p>
<p class='phone'>mccool (comment, not asked): equivalent to

<p class='phone'><cite>gerald:</cite> speaker</p>
<p class='phone'>in order for a switch to control a lamp, needs to
read a TD, so it knows how to act on a lamp</p>
<p class='phone'>but... state and semantic description are two
things</p>
<p class='phone'>need concise data represenation</p>
<p class='phone'>have limited processing power on the things</p>
<p class='phone'>what if the data model changes? how do we process
offline data? how do we combine states?</p>
<p class='phone'>may need to keep TDs, many need to describe

<p class='phone'>so can consider a linked data version of the

<p class='phone'>so if data model changes, then reflected in the

<p class='phone'>historical data would still refer to the old data
schema</p>
<p class='phone'>and the data contains links to things or other

<p class='phone'>how to do this?</p>
<p class='phone'>we have some software, RML streamer, that reads
state and converts it to RDF</p>
<p class='phone'>by combining it with information from the TD, i.e.
semantic annotation and data schema</p>
<p class='phone'>could also add additional semantics using manual
rules</p>
<p class='phone'>RML is the "RDF Mapping Language"</p>
<p class='phone'>then the resulting linked data can be used by
applications able to process linked data</p>
<p class='phone'>can add a form to the original TD as well to

<p class='phone'>question (matthias): how much complexity is there
in RML?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>scribe:</cite> may want to store only those
parts that are relevant?<br />
... in many settings there is a datalake, and the metadata is
out-of-band<br />
... what is the benefit of doing things this way?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> benefits are that it is
rule-based</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Matthias:</cite> it seems to need a
rule-based system; but TD is already modular, do you really need
the rules?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> but if you store this data,
and need to pick the parts you need<br />
... preconverting the data to RDF before storing ensure that the
semantics valid when the data was stored is captured<br />
... this makes it easier to process historical data<br />
... if the TDs or data schema changes</p>
<p class='phone'>question (victor): reusability. Do you have a
collection of rules for well-known schemas?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> do we have rules available;
yes, for a few cases<br />
... for data formats that is the main applications of RML to do
this conversion<br />
... and we have a lot of examples available</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Victor:</cite> how do I find the right
examples?<br />

<p class='phone'><cite>speaker:</cite> same</p>
<p class='phone'>validation for WoT; consider a TD data schema</p>
<p class='phone'>can validate the payload or the state</p>
<p class='phone'>but can also include semantic annotations and
linked data sets</p>
<p class='phone'>for the latter there are additional tools, eg
SHACL</p>
<p class='phone'>at first sight there seems to be a mismatch
between validating TDs and validating other linked data sources</p>
<p class='phone'>but there is a large overlap</p>
<p class='phone'>both TDs and SHACL are mechanisms to describe
similar things</p>
<p class='phone'>so if we want to validate linked data sets, may

<p class='phone'>this gives complementary validation</p>
<p class='phone'>provides translations between one mechanism and

<p class='phone'>question (victor): in which context are you using
the mapping?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> at this moment, not using it
is WoT, but for data schema validation, similar problem<br />
... and also existing linked data sets</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Victor:</cite> why would you need a mapping?
We do actually use SHACL... they are however not exactly
right<br />
... how would you prove they are equivalent?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> there probably is not a 1:1
mapping<br />
... this is more about mapping parts of the constraints</p>
<p class='phone'>question (sebastian): nice to combine two
validations in one step</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>scribe:</cite> both structural and semantic
validation</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> yes and no<br />
... if have JSON data schema, can use to validate non-JSON

... as long as the other data can also be converted to linked
data<br />
... can check if two datasets are compatible, for example</p>
<p class='phone'>question (coval): you said there is no 1:1

<h3 id="day2-item09">Making IoT useful for Fueling and Convenience
Retail - David Ezell (Conexxus)</h3>
<p class='phone'>industry perspective on why this work is
important</p>
<p class='phone'>think WoT has some very far-reaching impact</p>
<p class='phone'>brief description of industry, who Conexxus are,
past W3C standards, IoT-sized hole in our strategy</p>
<p class='phone'>industry is in US, "Fuel-Convenience-Retail"</p>
<p class='phone'>165M customers/day, $654/year in 2018, 154,000
store locations</p>
<p class='phone'>effective product control is crucial</p>
<p class='phone'>ownership tend to be in groups of 1 and 2... eg
NOT big companies, but individuals</p>
<p class='phone'>Conexxus is a trade consortium, do write
standards, but at a different level</p>
<p class='phone'>do advocate for semantics</p>
<p class='phone'>aim to improve profitability</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>example:</cite> have POS and back
office<br />
... had a standard</p>
<p class='phone'>but then found wanted to do direct store
delivery</p>
<p class='phone'>used EDI... recommend avoiding</p>
<p class='phone'>but W3C fixed, since could use XML instead</p>
<p class='phone'>the shift was transformative</p>
<p class='phone'>gave a list of semantic areas</p>
<p class='phone'>most important relate to POS and payments</p>
<p class='phone'>but did not have cloud APIs</p>
<p class='phone'>rather than back office, replace with cloud</p>
<p class='phone'>but need to integrate IoT data</p>
<p class='phone'>where to put it?</p>
<p class='phone'>felt that WoT allows us to integrate IoT data</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>example:</cite> gas pump, doors on pumps</p>
<p class='phone'>doors are sensored</p>
<p class='phone'>if they open when they do not, may indicate a
security hazard</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>cooler:</cite> recognize humans, doors open
and close, can figure out dwell time<br />
... can then understand better how to place products</p>
<p class='phone'>another example: company grew by acquisition</p>
<p class='phone'>have 44 different product lines using different
IoT standards!</p>
<p class='phone'>5 year outlook</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>baseline:</cite> POS -&gt; cloud</p>
<p class='phone'>but soon, control of the plant (cooling, security,
etc) will be important</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>scribe:</cite> then AI checkout, but also
barcode scanning</p>
<p class='phone'>aka AmazonGo; just recognize product</p>
<p class='phone'>robotic process automation</p>
<p class='phone'>logistics and delivery</p>
<p class='phone'>augmented employees</p>
<p class='phone'>food safety</p>
<p class='phone'>iot tracking</p>
<p class='phone'>many many use cases</p>
<p class='phone'>question (kathy): at iot fuze, target stores,
talking about iot</p>
<p class='phone'>have interally implemented Web Thing</p>
<p class='phone'>but... small stores, don't have an IT
infrastructure</p>
<p class='phone'>so can this be provided as a service?</p>
<p class='phone'>but also want some things to be local</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>Dom:</cite> have you considered "all
the other things": tracking products, etc</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> tracking is in fact
important, but might be overtaken by camera identification<br />
... tracking individual paths through the stores<br />
... keeping up with paths through the store will become more and
more difficult<br />
... many issues with keeping up with standards<br />
... have to also deal with legal compliance, e.g. taking food
stamps for things that are not eligible</p>

<h3 id="day2-item10">WoT Graph as Multiscale Digital-Twin for
Cyber-Physical Systems-of-Systems - Gilles Privat, Thierry Coupaye,
Sebastien Bolle and Philippe Raipin (Orange)</h3>
<p class='phone'><cite>speaker:</cite> Dr. Privat</p>
<p class='phone'>view WoT as a a graph to capture complex
systems</p>
<p class='phone'>rather than looking at single devices</p>
<p class='phone'>similar to what happened with the web: pages -&gt;
system</p>
<p class='phone'>known as web science; web graph as an object of
research; scale-free graphs, etc.</p>
<p class='phone'>WoT graph is interesting since it is a description
of physical systems, not just information</p>
<p class='phone'>3 foundations...</p>
<p class='phone'>first, hyperlinks</p>
<p class='phone'>second, nodes as digital twins of both connected
and non-connected entities</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>third:</cite> structural CPS description as
a graph and as a digital twin of the entire system</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>note:</cite> CPS = cyber-physical system</p>
<p class='phone'>simple example... streets and crossings, related
to cameras</p>
<p class='phone'>using property graphs rather than RDF graph</p>
<p class='phone'>arcs stand for actual physical connections</p>
<p class='phone'>is a model of a physical environment</p>
<p class='phone'>there are both smart things and non-smart
entities, eg roads</p>
<p class='phone'>then have a system composition as an overlay
graph</p>
<p class='phone'>show decomposition into subsystems</p>
<p class='phone'>also, devices often part of a larger system, eg
traffic lights are not stand-alone, but are parts of a larger
system</p>
<p class='phone'>can have nested systems and subsystems and the way
they depend on each other</p>
<p class='phone'>dependencies are NOT just a knowledge graph, but
represent actual physical dependencies</p>
<p class='phone'>but... will have knowledge and semantics
annotations as an overlay on a CPS graph</p>
<p class='phone'>in general, have physical entities, have things
twins, have systems, and then have ontology graph</p>
<p class='phone'>question: which applications are enabled by this
graph?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> can break technical
silos<br />
... want to address JOINT technical system in a single graph</p>
<p class='phone'>that can bridge how they are represented now in
each silo</p>
<p class='phone'>not one particular use case, but all potential
applications</p>
<p class='phone'>question: in theory, a graph for a BMS should
allow adaptation to any particular building</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> more than that, can bridge
systems that currently are in silos</p>
<p class='phone'>question (victor): who would actually define the
relations in the graph?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>scribe:</cite> and who would be paying for
it?</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>answer:</cite> key issue, economics<br />
... so far, actors do not have an incentive to have an overaching
system<br />
... can "make do" with silos<br />
... but we are working on a system, but need to surface
incentives</p>
<p class='phone'>for example, governments can require it</p>
<p class='phone'>would also have to prove that can improve working
of entire system</p>
<p class='phone'><cite>scribe:</cite> for example, can have use
cases that share information between multiple systems</p>
<p class='phone'>e.g. traffic management and parking</p>
<p class='phone'>occupancy could be used for security or energy
management</p>
