      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <ul>
<li>Technical issues related to internationalization and universal access across the globe. The Working Group provides advice and assistance related to internationalization, encompassing work related to international, linguistic, cultural, and writing system variations affecting W3C technologies. This advice should be provided to W3C Working Groups as early as possible in the development of specifications. The Working Group also tracks developments outside the W3C which have a bearing on the international Web, such as Unicode, IDN/ICANN issues, language tag and IRI developments at the IETF, JavaScript, etc.</li>
<li>Reviews and discussion of W3C technologies for internationalization issues, as these technologies develop. This encompasses a broad array of cultural, linguistic, technical and accessibility concerns. Review work may also include standards created by external standards bodies and organizations related to internationalization, if it is thought to be relevant to W3C technology. The Working Group maintains liaison relationships with these groups to ensure coordinated, consistent development of these standards.</li>
<li>Gathering requirements for linguistic support. The Working Group supports groups documenting typographic and other requirements for scripts and languages around the world, with a view to informing specification developers and browser/ebook implementers about what needs to be supported.</li>
<li>Outreach and inreach, in the forms of notes, articles, tutorials, presentations, tests and other resources to help specification writers, web masters, content authors, and others involved in developing and implementing the Web understand the issues involved and the techniques available with regard to supporting international use of Web technology.</li>
<li>Implementation support and guidance. The WG produces tests for international features of the Web Platform, and provides advice and support to browser/ebook implementers to assist in the adoption of those features.</li>
        </ul>
<div>
  <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <ul>
<li>Successfully complete reviews and provide assistance in a timely
  manner.</li>
  <li>Maintain good levels of feedback for outreach materials.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      </section>



      <section id="deliverables">
        <h2>
          Deliverables
        </h2>
<div id="normative">
  <h3>
            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>The formal documents produced by the Working Group are guidelines, best practices, requirements, and the like. These are best published as Working Group Notes. The Working Group will not produce Rec-track specifications, with the exception
            of maintaining the following W3C Recommendations:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-its-20070403/">Version 1.0</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/">Version 2.0</a></dt>
              <dd>These specifications define data categories and their implementation as a set of elements and attributes. ITS 2 adds additional concepts that are designed to foster the automated creation and processing of multilingual Web content.</dd>
              <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/">Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0: Fundamentals</a> </dt>
              <dd>It provides authors of specifications, software developers, and content developers with a common reference for interoperable text manipulation on the World Wide Web</dd>
              <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby">Ruby Annotation</a></dt>
              <dd>"Ruby" are short runs of text alongside the base text, typically used in East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or to provide a short annotation. This specification defines markup for ruby.</dd>
            </dl>
</div>


<h3>Language enablement</h3>
<p>The WG will work with, coordinate, and publish documents for various task forces within the Internationalization Interest Group, which produce document layout and related requirements for the Web Platform and Electronic Book technologies. The aim is to produce documents similar to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Japanese Layout Requirements</a> and gap-analysis documents for a range of scripts and languages, and other sources of information for implementers and content developers. See a list of <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/layout">currently available information</a>.</p>
<h3>Developer support</h3>
<p>Review of specifications of other W3C Working Groups for issues related to
internationalization, global usage, and cultural sensitivity is an essential
deliverable of the Internationalization  Working Group. This is not a
time-bound activity and the exact schedule of these reviews depends on the
progress of other Working Groups and the availability of resources in the
Internationalization Working Group. There is usually a regular supply of
review work to be done. The WG is doing its best to provide reviews  as early as possible in the specification development process, rather than waiting for Last Call. Review work leads to the raising and tracking of issues related to a technology. Discussions related to these issues are often much more time-consuming than the review itself.</p>
<p>In addition to discussions arising from reviews, the Working Group is often called upon to support other Working Groups with adhoc advice and discussion.</p>
<p>The WG will also develop checklists and guidance in written form for developers of specifications.</p>

<h3>Author support</h3>
<p>The WG will continue  to publish resources on the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/International/">Internationalization</a>
subsite to assist users of W3C and related Web technologies to internationalize
their applications, content, and services. These will include <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articlelist">articles,
tutorials, notes and reference pages</a>. </p>

<p>The Working Group will also maintain the W3C Internationalization  subsite, and develop and maintain ways for users of its resources to quickly
find the material they need, through a variety of means, including topic-based
and task-based indexing.</p>
<p>The WG will also provide internationalization-related best
  practices for users of Web technologies. These documents make the information
  available in a task based fashion, and are accessed by higher level web pages,
  targeted at specific user types and activities, that group together and link to
  all relevant information in summary form, with an organization that aids their
  use.</p>
<h3>Internationalization tests</h3>

<p>The WG will build on the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/International/tests/">existing foundation</a> to create
additional test pages and  summaries of results for the support of internationalization-related features in major browsers. The tests will be made available to the CSS and Web Platform test suites, where appropriate. These tests
explore support by user agents for internationalization related features, but
also serve an educational role. In addition to their support for techniques documents and articles, these tests are being used by content authors. In addition, other
W3C WGs have incorporated these tests into their own test suites, and user
agent development teams from all the major browsers have used these tests for
identifying, fixing or enhancing internationalization features or bugs in their browsers.</p>

<h3>Outreach activities</h3>

<p>The WG will seek to regularly present knowledge developed by the WG at
conferences and meetings where Web internationalization topics are relevant,
and to maintain a presence in internationalization and localization related
publications. It will also seek out key opportunities to present the
internationalization message to content authors and implementers, and to
encourage the provision of requirements for internationalization of W3C
technologies by in-country experts.</p>
<div id="timeline">
  <h3>Timeline</h3>
<p> WG deliverables are produced on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the
      charter, and the specific topics to be addressed by the working group and
      schedule information cannot be determined far in advance, but are driven by
      the needs and activities of the Web community.</p>

<p>Current work can be tracked using pages such as the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/projects/">Project Radar</a></li>
  <li>the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/projects/1">Review Radar</a></li>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
<p>The Internationalization WG will work with other horizontal review groups for accessibility,  performance, privacy, and security, and with the TAG, both to coordinate procedure and technical work.</p>
<p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>
<div>
  <h3 id="w3c-coordination">W3C Groups</h3>
<p>The Internationalization  WG will work with any W3C Working Group to ensure that
      their deliverables support international use. It will, however, have a special relationship with the:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/i18n-ig/"
 >Internationalization Interest Group</a></dt>
  <dd>The Internationalization  WG maintains close contact with the Internationalization IG. The Internationalization IG mailing
    list is notified when resources produced by this WG are submitted to  for review. Notifications are also sent to the IG lists when changes are made to issues in the GitHub repositories belonging to this group.  The Internationalization IG mailing list will also be used for sharing
    teleconference minutes and information about the work of this WG, sending out information about the
    progress of this WG at regular intervals, and soliciting feedback in
    general. Members of this WG are expected to also become members of the
    Internationalization IG to assure a smooth flow of information. The WG will also work closely with the
    task forces in the purvey of the Interest Group to publish documents about layout and 
    similar requirements.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="external-coordination">External Organizations</h3>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a></dt>
<dd>The Working Group will work with the WHATWG to ensure that their specifications (such as HTML and Encoding) reflect the needs of the global community of users. This will involve reviewing and tracking specification work, and raising and discussing relevant issues.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a></dt>
<dd>IETF working groups and other IETF activities that define technology
      with impact on Web Internationalization, such as the IRI WG and the work related to language tags.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode Technical Committee
  (UTC)</a></dt>
<dd>A liaison has been established. The Internationalization WG will review Unicode Consortium publications for Web-related internationalization features, where needed.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm">Ecma TC 39 (ECMAScript)</a></dt>
<dd> We will work with Ecma TC 39 on the development of the new EcmaScript Internationalization API Specification standard and the internationalization of the EcmaScript Language Specification (ECMA-262). The EcmaScript standard defines the core of the JavaScript programming language.</dd>
<dt>Supra-national and national standards bodies</dt>
<dd>The work of bodies such as ISO, ISO/IEC JTC1, JIS, and CEN, at
      the appropriate level (working group, subcommittee, technical
      committee,...), especially in so far as they work on general standards
      relevant to the internationalization of W3C technology or on national
      profiles of W3C specifications. Informal or formal contacts will be used
      as appropriate. The main groups, and corresponding areas for liaison,
      currently are:
<ul>
<li>ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 (character encoding, sorting): A formal liaison
          has been approved to track the evolution of ISO/IEC 10646 and to
          input W3C requirements.</li>
<li>ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG20 (characters in identifiers): A formal
          liaison has been approved to track developments and to input W3C
          requirements. The work program of this WG has recently been reduced
          considerably, and so this liaison may expire naturally.</li>
<li>ISO TC 37 and  the language resources community in general (e.g.ELRA), since corpora exchange is key to the language technoloiges needed for the multilingual web, and there is strong trend emerging for language resource sharing to take a semantic web/ RDF based approach</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a></dt>
<dd>The group follows developments in Universal Access that are being worked on by ICANN and related organizations.</dd>
<dt>Localization Industry Standards</dt>
<dd>The WG will work with the Localization industry, where needed,<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff/"></a> to ensure
      representation of the needs of these communities in the work of the
    WG.</dd>
<dt>Conference and publication organizers</dt>
<dd>The WG will maintain contacts with the major conference providers in
      the internationalization and localization fields, and will seek to place
      articles in publications in this area.</dd>
</dl>
<p>From time to time, the work of the Internationalization Working Group will be dependent on developments in groups outside the W3C. For example, specifications at the Unicode Consortium, or work on IRIs or language tags at the IETF, etc.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
<p>To be successful, the Internationalization  Working Group is expected to
have 5 or more active participants for its duration. Expectations for effective participation in
Internationalization  Working Group are flexible. On average, participants are expected to consume up to one work day per
week; one and a half days per week for editors.</p>
<p>
  The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
    <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/i18n-wg/">Internationalization Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
<p>This group primarily conducts its technical work using GitHub issues in a variety of <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/groups/">GitHub repositories</a>. Notifications of activity in those repositories and meeting minutes are sent to the public mailing lists of  the Internationalization Interest Group, which can be both read and written to by list subscribers (the Interest Group). </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
</p>
<p>There is another mailing list, <a
href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-core/">public-i18n-core@w3.org</a>, which can be used for discussions within the group, where needed. This is a publicly archived list, writeable only by Group members. It is notified of changes to issues in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/">i18n-activity repo</a> which we use to track review and other comments.</p>

      <section id="decisions">
      <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
<p>
    This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Internationalization Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
