          <p>A number of stakeholders have legitimate interests in what is done with information and they might also have legal rights to confidentiality or privacy. Bodies collecting or holding public sector information must respect these rights and should conform to the interests and wishes of the relevant stakeholders.

          <p>What should I do in order to ensure that privacy and other rights and interests are respected?</p>
          <p>Operation within the law requires due respect for privacy and intellectual property rights. A number of stakeholders have also legitimate interests in what is done with information that bodies collecting or holding public sector information should respect.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="solution"><h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>Bodies collecting or holding public sector information should maintain records of concerned stakeholders and their rights in the information and their wishes regarding it. Bodies collecting information must inform concerned stakeholders of the reasons for collecting it, of how it will be used, and of the visibility that it will have. Bodies collecting information should also collect the wishes of stakeholders regarding its treatment and, in particular, its visibility.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="why"><h2>Why is this a Best Practice?</h2>
          <p>Operation within the law requires due respect for privacy and intellectual property rights. Giving due consideration to the stakeholders' interests gives citizens and companies more confidence in government, and makes them more willing to supply information. Also, it involves greater engagement with them, which in itself contributes to the quality of government and the health of democratic society</p>
          <p>Following this best practice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>helps to ensure that the stakeholders’ interests are considered and their rights are respected;</li>
            <li>helps to <a href="/2013/share-psi/bp/cod/">categorise data accorging to its openness</a>;</li>
            <li>provides an input into the assessment of risks related to the data release.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="implement"><h2>How do I implement this Best Practice?</h2>
          <p>Identify rights and interests of the relevant stakeholders such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>People and companies that the information is about,</li>
            <li>People and companies whose property the information is about, and</li>
            <li>People and companies that have created or added value to the information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Bodies collecting or holding public sector information include public-sector bodies and also commercial bodies involved in the collection, processing, and publication of the information.</p>
